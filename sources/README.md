# Sources

This directory contains the sources for the 20th edition of "The Catholic Religion" by Rev. Vernon Staley.

## scanned.pdf

The scanned PDF of the 20th edition.

## ocr/

The OCRed text from the scanned PDF. The page numbers are not correct.

This was generated using [Claude Sonnet 3.5](https://www.anthropic.com/products/claude-3-sonnet).

Because Sonnet has a strict content filter, some pages were not OCRed.

The quickest way I've found to get around this is to use the Windows Snipping tool to take a screenshot of the page from `scanned.pdf` and use the built-in OCR function to copy the text.

OCR'd text is imperfect, but it's a good starting point.
