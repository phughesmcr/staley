# 176 The Faith of the Church.

whereas the English phrase begins, so to speak, at the other
end, and lays greater stress on the supremely privileged
motherhood. The doctrinal intention is the same in both
cases." (*Waymarks in Church History*, p. 180.)

In speaking of the blessed Virgin as 'Mother of God,' it
is not meant that she was mother of the divine nature, but
of the human nature of him who is God, and who took of
her that human nature. She is mother of 'the divine
Son considered as under the conditions of incarnation.'

## 4. The Earthly Life of our Lord.

Of the miraculous conception of our blessed
Lord, we have already spoken. In the womb
of the blessed Virgin Mary the Godhead was
mysteriously united to the manhood, by the
operation of the Holy Ghost. The Incarnation
dates from the time that the angel Gabriel
announced the tidings to the blessed Virgin
Mary at Nazareth. This event is known as the
Annunciation, and is commemorated in the
Church on March 25, commonly called Lady-
day. We have also a daily memorial of the
Incarnation in the Song of the blessed Virgin
Mary, "My soul doth magnify the Lord," sung
at evensong. This Psalm was uttered by the
blessed Virgin upon her visit to St. Elizabeth,
after the angel had made known to her that
she should be the mother of the Lord. Nine
months after the Annunciation, our Lord was
born at Bethlehem, the city of David, whither
the Virgin Mother had resorted with St. Joseph,
to be enrolled in the census ordered by the
Roman emperor. Many years before, the
prophet Micah had foretold that our Lord
should be born in that city.[^1] The Church
