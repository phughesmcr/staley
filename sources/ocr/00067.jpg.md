# Grades amongst the Bishops of the Church. 47

patriarchates took their names from the cities
in which the patriarchs resided. The patriarchs
were regarded as the five presidents of the
Church. Amongst the patriarchs, the custom
of the Church allowed grades in rank of honour.
The first place was naturally given to Rome,
because Rome was the capital of the empire,
and also from its connection with the greatest
of the apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul. If
religious considerations alone had determined
the order of precedence, Jerusalem must have
ranked first. Next to Rome, in rank of honour,
came Constantinople, as being the seat of the
Roman Emperor and his court, and hence
called New Rome. In the general Council
of Chalcedon held A.D. 451, it was enacted that
"as the fathers fitly bestowed precedence upon
the throne of Old Rome because it was the
imperial city, and the 150 bishops most beloved
of God"—i.e., the fathers of the second general
Council A.D. 381,—"moved by the same con-
sideration, awarded equal precedence to the
most holy throne of New Rome," i.e., Con-
stantinople, "judging reasonably that the city
honoured by the seat of the Empire, and by
the Senate, should enjoy equal rank with the
old imperial Rome, and like her be magnified
in ecclesiastical matters, having the second place
after her."

To sum up what has been said, we again
quote the words of the Rev. F. W. Puller,—

pendent of any patriarch. Originally the Roman jurisdiction
was limited to the seven provinces of Central and Southern
Italy, and to the three islands of Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily.
The subject is fully treated in Puller's *Primitive Saints*.
