# 288 The Sacraments.

must confirm. Two of these chief ministers,
at a busy time in the Church's history, came
a journey of forty or fifty miles to lay their
hands upon the baptized, that they might re-
ceive the Holy Ghost. "Then laid they their
hands on them, and they received the Holy
Ghost."

In Acts xix. 1, etc., we have the record of St.
Paul first baptizing, and then confirming twelve
persons at Ephesus. "They were baptized in
the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul
had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost
came on them."

In naming the six rudiments of the doctrine
of Christ, the writer of the Epistle to the
Hebrews speaks of "the doctrine of baptisms,
and of laying on of hands;" [^1] where the two
sacraments are again coupled together. We
have probably a reference to a like association
in Acts ii. 38, and in Tit. iii. 5. Thus, Con-
firmation is believed to be the completion of
Baptism. For 1000 years throughout the whole
Church, Confirmation immediately followed
Baptism, even in the case of infants; and this
is the present custom of the Eastern Church.
In the West it is usual to defer Confirmation
until children have arrived at years of discretion,
and with us it is accompanied by a renewal of
the vows of Baptism.

This renewal of vows is not Confirmation.
In point of fact, this adjunct of Confirmation
has only been in the Prayer Book for about
250 years. The renewal of vows is a good
and edifying accompaniment to Confirmation,
though no necessary part of the sacrament.
