# CHAPTER IV.

## PRAYER.

RELIGION is the bond between the soul
and God. This bond is one which may
be strengthened or weakened, as every soul
wills. It is weakened, and even broken, by sin;
it is strengthened by prayer. Prayer braces
the bond of religion from man's side, and draws
down the grace which strengthens it from God's
side. Without prayer the soul loses its hold
upon God. God soon fades away from the
mental vision of those who never pray.

Of all beings here below, man alone prays.
In many ways we closely resemble the lower
animals, but there is this striking difference
between us and them,—we can pray, and they
cannot do so. The reason for this is, that man
has a rational soul, whilst a beast has not. It
is natural to us to pray, for the soul was made
for communion with God. If we look at the
handle, barrel, and wards of a key, we say,
This key was made to turn in a lock: if we
look within ourselves, we can say,—My soul
was made for God, and to hold communion with
him. When the soul prays, it is doing that
for which it was made. This communion with
God is called Prayer. St. Augustine defines
prayer to be, "the turning of the heart to God."
