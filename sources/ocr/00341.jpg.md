## III. Regeneration.

There is much confusion in many minds con-
cerning Conversion and Regeneration. This
confusion arises in a great measure from a mis-
apprehension of our Lord's words to Nicodemus
as to the necessity of the new birth, recorded in
St. John iii. 1-14.

Regeneration is the being born again "of
water and of the Spirit." It is the act of God
the Holy Ghost upon the soul in Baptism,—a
single definite act which can never be repeated.
In Baptism, God gives the soul the new birth,
or, in other words, regenerates it. In Regenera-
tion we receive a new nature, and pass out from
the natural into the supernatural order of things.
This new nature is as a seed planted within the
soul, and it is intended to grow and to bear fruit.[^1]

Conversion, as we shall see in the next sec-
tion, consists in the conscious turning of the

[^1]: "We are made new creatures by a present change work-
ing in our moral nature ; that is to say, through our regenera-
tion in holy baptism. By the love of God electing us to a
new birth of the Spirit, and by the Holy Ghost working
through that visible sacrament, we are translated from wrath
to grace, from the power of darkness to the kingdom of his
dear Son. Old things pass away, and all things become new
around the regenerate man. We look upward to a new
heaven ; we stand upon a new earth. . . . We are
brought under the shadow of the cross, within whose
dominion the powers of sin are bound. We receive that
thing which by nature we cannot have—a baptism not of
water only, but of the Holy Ghost. . . . In baptism
we are so made new creatures, that we may either grow
daily to the sanctity of angels, or may fall, and hold our
Regeneration in unrighteousness ; as angels that kept not
their first estate still hold their angelic nature in anguish
and in warfare against God."—Manning, *Sermons*, vol. i.
pp. 20, 21.
