# 258 The Sacraments.

Our Lord's authority can be traced directly
for the institution of Holy Baptism, the Holy
Eucharist, Penance, and Holy Order. Matri-
mony, instituted by God from the beginning,
was raised by our Lord to a higher dignity;
whilst the expression, "in the name of the Lord,"
used by St. James¹ of Unction, compared with
St. Mark vi. 13, points to his authority for this
ordinance also. Although there is no record
of the institution of Confirmation in the New
Testament, yet we have the highest reasons for
believing that it was ordered by our Lord him-
self before his ascension. Confirmation was
practised by the apostles, and in Heb. vi. 1, 2,
it is declared to be one of "the principles of the
doctrine of Christ." Moreover, Confirmation
conveys the fulness of the gift of the Holy
Ghost, which no rite of the Church's appointing
could do, without divine authority.

The sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist
claim special attention, for our Lord has given
them a peculiar prominence. They are the
instruments of INWARD LIFE, according to our
Lord's declaration, that Baptism is A NEW BIRTH,
and that in the Eucharist we eat THE LIVING
BREAD. They are sometimes called the Sacra-
ments of the Gospel, because they have their
visible sign or ceremony ordained by Christ
in the Gospels. On his authority, the Church
has ever held them to be 'generally necessary
to salvation,' i.e., for all men in general, without
exception, where they can possibly be had. On
the plain testimony of our Lord, no one can
hope for salvation who wilfully neglects to use
the divinely appointed means of receiving it.
