# The Conversion of England. 77

their spiritual citadel, which ended in the submis-
sion of England to the gentle yoke of Christ." [^1]

A distinguished writer of the Roman Church,
in describing the work of the Roman and Celtic
missionaries makes a similar admission, in these
words,â€”

"Of the eight kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon
confederation, that of Kent alone was exclu-
sively won and retained by Roman monks,
whose first attempts among the East Saxons
and Northumbrians ended in failure. In
Wessex and in East Anglia, the Saxons of
the West and the Angles of the East were
converted by the combined action of continental
missionaries and Celtic monks. As to the two
Northumbrian kingdoms, and those of Essex
and Mercia, which comprehended in themselves
more than two-thirds of the territory occupied
by the German conquerors, these four countries
owed their final conversion exclusively to the
peaceful invasion of the Celtic monks,[^2] who
not only rivalled the zeal of the Roman monks,
but who, the first obstacles once surmounted,
shewed much more perseverance and gained
much more success." [^3]

trained under the Celtic bishop of Lindisfarne.
