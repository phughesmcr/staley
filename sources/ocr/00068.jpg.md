# 48 Grades amongst the Bishops of the Church.

"By divine right all bishops were inherently equal, but by custom and ecclesiastical legislation the bishops of the metropolitical sees acquired certain rights, which were delegated to them by their brother bishops. Moreover, among the most important Churches a certain order of precedence grew up, which corresponded with the civil dignity of the cities in which those Churches existed; and, finally, the Churches which were founded by the apostles were treated with peculiar reverence."¹ We must be careful to note, that, whilst the distinction between bishops, priests, and deacons, is a matter of divine appointment, these grades amongst bishops are not so. They were made for the sake of convenience in the better government of the Church. The distinctions are distinctions of honour, and of influence, and of strictly limited jurisdiction, and are useful as a matter of Church order; they are not essential to the Church's life. St. Cyprian teaches this, when he speaks of our Lord "giving to all the apostles an equal power," and of their being "endued with an equal fellowship both of honour and power."² St. Jerome, writing A.D. 393, says likewise,— "wherever there is a bishop, whether it be at Rome, or Eugubium, whether it be at Constantinople, or at Rhegium, whether it be at Alexandria, or at Zoan, his dignity is one, and his priesthood is one . . . all alike are successors of the apostles."³
