# 314 Prayer.

Solomon, "falleth seven times." [^1] It was the
great Augustine who taught his hearers that the
earnest use of this petition obtains pardon for
such daily imperfections. We do not in this
petition pray for first forgiveness, but to cover
the daily sins which, even in a state of grace,
by our frailty we commit. St. Augustine's
words are,—"Baptism is provided on account
of all sins; prayer is provided on account of
little sins, without which no one is able to
live. What does the Prayer say? 'Forgive
us our trespasses, as we forgive them that
trespass against us.' We are cleansed once
for all in baptism, we are cleansed daily by
prayer." [^2]

We pray that God will so forgive us, as we
forgive others. This is the only petition in the
'Our Father' conditional upon our doing some-
thing. "As we forgive," means in like manner
as we forgive. The reason why Christ has thus
taught us to pray is, because we are not fit to
receive mercy from God until we have shown it
to others. "Blessed are the merciful: for they
shall obtain mercy." [^3] It has been said, 'He
that cannot forgive others, breaks down the
bridge over which he must pass himself."

vi. "AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION."

The last petition teaches that, as sinful
creatures, we need pardon: this petition teaches
that, as helpless and weak, we need guidance
and succour. The petition may mean either,—

[^1]: Prov. xxiv. 16.
[^2]: Sermon to Catechumens, 15.
[^3]: St Matt. v. 7.
