# The Ministry of the Church.

As other heresies arose, they were met and
condemned in like manner; the bishops speaking
out, and the Church at large confirming their
decisions.

iv. THE EPISCOPATE, THE INSTRUMENT AND
PLEDGE OF GRACE.

The streams of grace flow in the Church
through the sacraments, which are called 'the
channels of grace.' Our Lord committed the
sacraments to the keeping of the apostles and
their successors, the bishops and clergy of the
Church. St. Paul speaks of the clergy as
"stewards of the mysteries of God."[^1] These
"mysteries" are certain deep truths revealed
by God, which pass the understanding, such as
'the mystery of the Holy Incarnation;' but
chiefly and above all, "the mysteries of God"
mean the sacraments, called in all parts of the
Church by the name of 'the holy mysteries.'
Of these sacraments the bishops and clergy are
the stewards,â€”the guardians and dispensers.

The sacraments can be duly celebrated only
by those who have been authorized by Christ;
that is, by the apostles and their successors.
This is true not so much as a matter of mere
order, but as resting on our Lord's revealed
will. Unless the sacraments are ministered
by persons duly qualified, there is no security
that they convey grace. Thus it comes about
that the bishops, and those sent by them secure
the channels of grace; in other words, the means
of grace depend upon a lawful ministry.

The power and authority to minister the
sacraments was given by Christ in the first
