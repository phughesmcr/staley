# The Foundation of the Church. 13

Whichever way it is, the result is the same;
for the Church is one with Christ, and He is
one with the Church. "He is the head of
the body, the Church."[^1]

[^1]: Col. i. 18.

NOTE ON CHRIST'S PROMISE TO ST. PETER.

(St. Matt. xvi. 17-20.)

The Church has received no certain or fixed tradition as
to what our Lord meant by "the rock" in this passage.
Some of the fathers taught that Christ himself is the rock,
others that the faith in his Godhead and Messiahship which
St. Peter confessed is meant, others again that St. Peter is
the rock. Several of the fathers held two of these opinions
together, and some held all three. St. Augustine in his
earlier writings taught that St. Peter is the rock, but he
afterwards gave up that view, and held that Christ is the
rock. His words are,—"I said in a certain place of the
apostle St. Peter, that upon him, as upon the rock, the
Church was founded. . . . But I know that afterwards I
most often expounded that saying of our Lord,—'Thou art
Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my Church' as
meaning upon him whom Peter confessed saying,—'Thou
art the Christ, the Son of the living God.' Let the reader
choose which of these two interpretations is the more
probable" (*Retract.* lib. i. c. 21). The fact that this great
teacher changed his mind as to the meaning of the passage,
and left it an open question to his readers, shews that he
had no idea that any important doctrine depends on its
interpretation.

It is very noticeable that, if we except the popes and
persons closely associated with the Roman see, the fathers,
who understand the rock to be St. Peter, in no way connect
our Lord's promise with the institution of the papacy.

St. Peter may be regarded as the rock, because he first
confessed belief in the person and office of Christ, and first
was nominated to be an apostle. He was first in order
amongst the twelve, but had no jurisdiction over the rest
of the apostles. He was not their lord, but their leader:
