# 130 The Anglican Principle as to the Truth.

"To believe the Scripture and the Creeds in the sense
of the ancient Primitive Church, to receive the four great
General Councils so much magnified by antiquity, to believe
all points of doctrine, generally received as fundamental
in the Church of Christ, is a faith in which to live and die
cannot but give salvation."â€”Archbishop Laud, *Conference
with Fisher*, xxxviii. 1.
