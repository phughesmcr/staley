# The Ministry of the Church. 19

duty to represent God to the people as his
ambassadors. An ambassador is one who
represents the king who sends him. The clergy
can say,—" We are ambassadors for Christ, as
though God did beseech you by us : we pray you
in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."[^1]

It is most important to notice this. The
members of parliament who govern our land,
receive their authority from below,—from those
who choose them as their representatives : they
represent the people. But the ministers of
the Church receive their authority by com-
mission from Jesus Christ, whom they repre-
sent. They are the messengers, watchmen, and
stewards of the Lord. Thus the authority of
the priesthood of the Church of God is derived
from above. The clergy are sent by God to
the people. Every minister of the true Church
can say,—Christ has sent me to represent
him : I speak and act for him : I am his
minister : I am come to minister " in the person
of Christ."[^2]

It is important also to notice that when
Christ sends men to be his representatives,

honour to himself.' The Christian ministry satisfies both
these conditions. . . . The Christian minister is God's
ambassador to men ; he is charged with the ministry of
reconciliation ; he unfolds the will of heaven ; he declares
in God's name the terms on which pardon is offered ; and
he pronounces in God's name the absolution of the penitent.
. . . Again the Christian minister is the representative of
man to God—of the congregation primarily, of the individual
indirectly as a member of the congregation. The alms, the
prayers, the thanksgivings of the community are offered
through him. He is a priest, as the mouthpiece, the
delegate, of a priestly race."—Bishop Lightfoot, *The
Christian Ministry*, pp. 207, 208.
