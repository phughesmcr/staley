# The Ministry of the Church.

it. In Crete, Titus receives explicit authority
from St. Paul to ordain presbyters; at Ephesus,
Timothy has particular directions from St. Paul
respecting the way in which charges against
presbyters are to be received. Thus we see
in Timothy and Titus the exercise of what
is distinctive both in episcopal orders and
episcopal jurisdiction; and unless the pastoral
epistles are not of apostolic origin, the three
orders existed in their completeness under the
eyes of St. Paul. Within the compass of the
New Testament, there are two other facts which
point to the establishment of the episcopate in
apostolic times. One is the position of St.
James-the-less at Jerusalem; he seems to have
been an apostle who already occupied the more
localized and restricted position of a bishop.
This appears in the place assigned to him at
the Council of Jerusalem, and in the formal
visit which St. Paul paid him at a later period,
but especially in the unanimous testimony of
the second century, which spoke of him as
Bishop of Jerusalem. The other fact is the
representation in the Apocalypse of the 'angels'
of the seven churches. What were these angels?
Guardian spirits of the churches they cannot
have been, since some of them were guilty of
grave faults. Nor can they have been the
churches themselves, since St. John distin-
guishes the angels and the churches as having
the distinct symbols of stars and candlesticks.
Each angel represents a church, for the faith
and practice of which he is responsible; and
it would be difficult to express more exactly
the position of a primitive bishop."[^1]
