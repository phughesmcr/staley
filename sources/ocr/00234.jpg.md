# The Faith of the Church. 215

the Holy Eucharist; yet at first they did none
of these things,—they waited.

For what did they wait? They waited for
the fulfilment of Christ's own promise; for that
power which was to come upon them from on
high. They waited for the coming of the Holy
Ghost, the Life-Giver.[^1]

Between Ascension-day and Whitsunday there
is no record of the apostles performing any
ministerial actions. They neither taught, bap-
tized, confirmed, nor celebrated the Holy Eucha-
rist.[^2] All was in a state of suspense, until the
promised power should be theirs, which should
enable them to do all that Christ had bidden
them. They were as soldiers who had received
their orders, but were waiting for their arms.
Before Pentecost, the Church was as "the dry
bones" spoken of by Ezekiel,[^3] brought indeed
together, but motionless, awaiting the breath
from on high.

After the descent of the Holy Ghost all this
was changed. Suspense was at an end. The
apostles at once began to carry out all the in-
structions which Christ had given them. We
read of their going forth immediately to labour
in all places, teaching, baptizing, confirming,
celebrating the Holy Eucharist, and ordaining
others. From all this we learn that the coming
of the Holy Ghost upon the Church was an
event of the greatest importance.

We must not think that the Holy Spirit came

[^1]: Acts i. 4, 8.
[^2]: The Sacraments ordinarily depend for their validity
upon the operation of the Holy Ghost, who was not given
until Jesus was glorified,—a process which seems to have
taken ten days to accomplish (St. John vii. 39. Acts i. 4, 5).
