# The Faith of the Church. 187

Our blessed Saviour was nailed to the cross
at nine o'clock in the morning; at twelve o'clock
a mysterious darkness fell upon the face of
nature, which lasted until three o'clock, when
He died. During the six hours He hung upon
the cross, He uttered seven sayings, known as
the seven words from the cross:—

1. Jesus prayed for his murderers in the
words,—"Father, forgive them; for they know
not what they do."

2. He pardoned the penitent thief who was
crucified with him, saying,—"To-day shalt thou
be with me in paradise."

3. He commended his blessed mother to the
care of the apostle St. John,—"Woman, behold
thy son! . . . Behold thy mother!"

4. Forsaken by God, He uttered the awful
cry,—"My God, my God, why hast thou for-
saken me?"

5. He said,—"I thirst."

6. He spoke of the completion of his redemp-
tive work, saying, "It is finished."

7. In the moment of death, He yielded up his
soul into his Father's keeping with the words,—
"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit."

The death of Jesus was the parting of his
soul from his body; but neither soul nor body,
thus sundered, were for one moment separated
from his Godhead. His death was not of
necessity as in our case, but by his own will.

By his cross and passion our incarnate Lord
wrought the great atonement,[^1]—the reconcili-
ation of man to God: He redeemed us from the
power of Satan, from sin, and from the punish-

[^1]: Atonement, or at-one-ment, signifies that man is made at one with God in Jesus Christ.
