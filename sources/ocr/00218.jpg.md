# The Faith of the Church. 199

The Resurrection of our Lord is better attested than any other fact in history.[^1] He was seen alive eight times after He rose again by his most intimate friends, who could not be deceived, —on one occasion by above five hundred persons at once.[^2] One of the apostles, St. Thomas, refused to believe that his Master was risen, and was only convinced by seeing the very wound-marks on his sacred body.[^3]

The Resurrection is the central truth of Christianity. "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain."[^4] Our Lord's rising again to life is the proof of the truth of all He taught, and of his claim to be the incarnate Son of God. He himself gave this test in saying,—"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up, . . . He spake of the temple of his body,"[^5] and alluded to his death and resurrection. It is on this account that we find the Resurrection of Jesus the great topic of the preaching of the apostles.

[^1] "The evidence of our Lord's life and death and resurrection may be, and often has been, shewn to be satisfactory; it is good according to the common rules for distinguishing good evidence from bad. Thousands and thousands of persons have gone through it piece by piece, as carefully as ever judge summed up upon a most important cause. I have myself done it many times over, not to persuade others but to satisfy myself. I have been used for many years to study the history of other times, and to examine and weigh the evidence of those who have written about them; and I know of no one fact in the history of mankind which is proved by better and fuller evidence of every sort to the understanding of a fair inquirer, than the great sign which God has given us, that Christ died and rose again from the dead."—Arnold, *Rugby Sermons*, p. 14.
