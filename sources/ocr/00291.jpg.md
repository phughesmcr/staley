# 274 The Sacraments.

trine of the Eucharistic Sacrifice had been
corrupted by medieval additions.

The reason why the Sacrificial aspect of the
Holy Eucharist is not more fully recognized in
the Book of Common Prayer is, that the idea
of Communion, which was a primary purpose
of our Lord in giving us the Holy Sacrament
of his body and blood, had in the middle ages
been suffered to fall into the background. The
majority of persons in those times received
but once a year; and six times a year was
considered a large allowance for devoted women
in the religious houses. In restoring the idea
of the importance of Communion, and as a
revulsion from the unhappy teaching of which
we have been speaking, the true balance was
lost; and, in the reaction, the sacrificial aspect
of this Great Service was, by force of circum-
stances, not so fully recognized in drawing up
our Eucharistic Service as it ought to have
been. But the use of the Prayer of Consecration
by the priest, in which the New Testament
account of our LORD'S institution is closely
followed, is sufficient indication of the Church's
intention in regard to this important matter.
Moreover, in the Prayer of Oblation, we ask
God to accept "this our sacrifice of praise and
thanksgiving," the old term for the Eucharistic
Sacrifice, and go on to speak of the offering of
"ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reason-
able, holy, and lively sacrifice" unto God. [^1]

[^1]: This is the sacrifice of Christians, the many who are
one body in Christ, which also the Church continually cele-
brates in the sacrament of the altar known to the faithful,
where it is shewn to her that in the very thing which
she offers, she herself also is offered."â€”St. Augustine, *De
Civitate*, x. 6.
