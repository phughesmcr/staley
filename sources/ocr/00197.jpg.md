# 178 The Faith of the Church.

commemorates the birth of our Lord on Christ  
mas-day.

The entrance of the Son of God into the world  
in human form was an event of unspeakable  
importance. It was an event well known in  
heaven, for it is recorded that the mystery of the  
Incarnation was revealed to the angel-hosts  
for their acceptance. "When He bringeth  
in the firstbegotten into the world, He saith,  
And let all the angels of God worship him."¹

warned, hastened to Bethlehem, and there  
found the divine child, with his mother, in a  
cave or stable, in which, from the crowded  
state of the inn, they had been obliged to  
seek shelter.

On the eighth day after birth, our blessed  
Lord was circumcised, and received his name  
of JESUS, which means 'God the Saviour.'  
Thirty-two days later, He, with his blessed  
mother, further complied with the Jewish law.  
Jesus was presented in the temple, and the  
blessed Virgin was purified after childbirth,  
though the conception of her divine child by  
the Holy Ghost, without human father, rendered  
such a ceremony needless. It was on this  
occasion that an aged servant of God, named  
Simeon, took our blessed Lord in his arms,  
and uttered the touching 'Nunc Dimittis,'  
"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
