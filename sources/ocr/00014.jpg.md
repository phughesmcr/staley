# Preface.

May God bless this humble attempt to bring home to members of the Anglican Communion the great truths and principles contained in the "established doctrine and laudable practice of the whole Catholic Church of Christ," which are their lawful heritage, and which our great divines at all times, and the revered leaders of the Catholic Revival in this century, have earnestly maintained and taught.

CLEWER, FEBRUARY, 1895.

# PREFACE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION.

THE author has taken the opportunity afforded by the call for the Eighth Edition, to re-write and enlarge Chapter V. of Part Second. In so doing he has endeavoured to meet the recent unworthy attack made on the validity of Anglican Orders by the bull of Leo XIII., issued in September, 1896. He desires to express his thanks to the Rev. F. W. Puller for examining the portion of the Chapter which deals with the papal bull in question.

SOUTH ASCOT, NOVEMBER, 1896.

# PREFACE TO THE THIRTEENTH EDITION.

THE re-setting of the type for the Thirteenth Edition has enabled the author to read through with carefulness the whole of the following pages, and to make several verbal alterations which suggested themselves as improvements. A distinct omission in previous editions has been supplied by the addition of a short article on "The Fatherhood of God" (page 154). The author begs to record his deep thankfulness for the continued widespread circulation of this Manual.
