# Anglican Orders. 105

which the apostolic succession in the English
Church was continued after the final breach
with Rome. Objections have been, until re-
cently, urged as to the validity of his consecration,
which are met thus:

(1) It was not till many years after archbishop
Parker's consecration that the fact was ques-
tioned. A miserable charge known as the 'Nag's
Head fable' was trumped up to disprove the
consecration. "In 1604, i.e. forty-five years after
Parker's consecration, an exiled Anglo-Romanist
priest of the name of Holywood, in a contro-
versial book printed at Antwerp, alleged that
Parker and some of the other bishops were
consecrated (so to call it) by a mock ceremony,
all together at one time on a day unspecified at
the Nag's Head tavern, by Dr. Scory (who had
been really consecrated bishop in 1551), who
was himself in turn consecrated in the like mock
way by them. To this story other subsequent
writers of the same stamp and class added a
specification of three or four names of the other
bishops, and finally of fifteen in all. . . . During
the twenty years following 1604, every Anglo-
Romanist writer, with scarcely a single exception,
and with suicidal eagerness, repeats the story
exultingly, although in varying and contradictory
forms."[^1] The fact of Parker's consecration is
now placed beyond all doubt, and the Nag's
Head fable, which bears upon its face the mark

covered in the next century in the consecration of archbishop
Laud, in whom the three lines of the Italian, Irish, and
English successions met. See *The Priest's Prayer Book*,
