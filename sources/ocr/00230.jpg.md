# The Faith of the Church. 211

also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
shall be called the Son of God."[^1] In the words
of St. Ambrose, "We cannot doubt the Spirit
to be Creator, whom we admit to be the author
of the Lord's incarnation." Our blessed Lord
taught the divinity of the Holy Spirit, when He
declared that "all manner of sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy
against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven
unto men."[^2] He could not have thus spoken,
if the Holy Ghost is but a creature, and not
God. St. Peter told Ananias that he lied to
the Holy Ghost, and that in so doing he had
not lied unto men, but unto God.[^3] St. Paul
teaches that the Church is the temple of God,
because the Spirit of God indwells her.[^4] So
again, the Nicene Creed declares the Holy
Ghost to be "the Lord," i.e., the Lord Jehovah,
"who with the Father and the Son together
is worshipped and glorified."

This Creed also bestows upon the Holy Spirit
the title of "the Giver of Life," i.e., the quick-
ener, or life-giver. In the account of the crea-
tion of the world, He is described as "moving
(or brooding) upon the face of the waters."[^5]
By the vital energy of the divine Spirit, the
works of creation were brought to perfection.
As the Life-Giver, the Spirit overshadowed
the blessed Virgin Mary, thus enabling her to
conceive in her womb the incarnate Lord.[^6]
On the day of Pentecost, the eternal Spirit
descended upon the Church to fill her with
divine life, and to abide with her for ever.
Jesus Christ is 'the Life,' and the Holy Spirit
