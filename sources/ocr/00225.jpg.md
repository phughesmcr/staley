into heaven itself, there to present his sacrifice,
and "to appear in the presence of God for us."¹

The action of the high priesthood of our Lord
in offering himself in heaven, is the second part
of his sacrifice. He is represented in the Reve-

slain,"² i.e., with the wound-marks upon his
sacred form. We know that Jesus bore the
prints of the nails and spear in his risen body,
and that He carried this body so marked into
heaven. It is the work of our Lord as our high
priest to plead continually for his Church in the
presence of his Father. It would seem that He
bears the scars, the tokens of his passion, on his
glorified form in heaven, for this very purpose.
"He ever liveth to make intercession for us."³
It is through his perpetual pleading that the
gifts of grace are ours in the Church. As the
Head of the Body, our blessed Lord is the
medium through which grace descends upon us,
his members. "When He ascended up on high,
He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto
men."⁴

unceasing pleading of Jesus in the heavens.

heavenly pleading. Before He ascended to
exercise his office as our great high priest, He
ordained a great mystical service in which we,
on earth, may have a real part in that which
He does above. Jesus Christ is now pleading
