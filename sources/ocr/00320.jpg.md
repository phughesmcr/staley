# The Sacraments. 301

Bishop Forbes wrote,—"The Unction of the Sick is the lost pleiad[^1] of the Anglican firmament. One must at once confess and deplore that a distinctly Scriptural practice has ceased to be commanded in the Church of England. Excuses may be made of 'corrupt following of the apostles,' in that it was used, contrary to the mind of St. James, when all hope of the restoration of bodily health was gone;[^2] but it cannot be denied that there has been practically lost an apostolic practice, whereby, in case of grievous sickness, the faithful were anointed and prayed over, for the forgiveness of their sins, and to restore them, if God so willed, or to give them spiritual support in their maladies. 'Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer

[^2]: It is this abuse which is responsible for our disuse of Unction since the Reformation. Dr. Pusey says,—"In regard to the Anointing of the Sick, the Greek Church follows strictly the direction of St. James. The devout sick, at least, send to the physician of the soul as well as of the body, and in 'the anointing of the sick,' they look for benefit both to the body, if it should so please God, and to the soul. A Russian priest informed me of a case, which he knew, of a man, who, by the use of anointing, with the prayer of faith by the presbyters, had been raised up three times from dangerous illness. Had the Roman Church adhered to this practice, we could never have had the mention of 'the corrupt following of the apostles' (Article xxv.); for that language relates to the then custom, not to anoint the sick until they were 'in extremis.' Had they in the Roman Church retained the practice as the Greek Church retains it, we should doubtless have retained it also."—*Eirenicon* i., pp. 219, 220.
