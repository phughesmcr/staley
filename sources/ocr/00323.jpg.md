# 304 Prayer.

St. John Damascene says,—" Prayer is the elevation or ascent of the soul to God." It is not only natural to pray, but God has bidden us do so. There is hardly any subject more continually brought to our notice in the Bible, both by precept and example, than that of prayer. The Holy Scriptures give innumerable instances of prayer, frequently telling us the very words used so acceptably to God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is our Great Example, and in the Gospels we often read of him praying, many of the prayers which He said being recorded there. He taught his disciples to pray, and gave them and us the best of all prayers,—the Lord's Prayer. No one can read the Scriptures without learning that prayer is a duty and a necessity, as well as a high privilege.

Prayer is the soul's converse with God. When we see a man upon his knees we can say,—There is one who holds communion with his God.[^1] This communion with God in prayer, involves much more than the mere asking for certain things. There are five parts of prayer, viz.,

1. Adoration,   } which concern God's
2. Thanksgiving, }           glory.
3. Confession, } which concern our individual
4. Petition,   }           needs.
5. Intercession, which concerns the needs of others.

[^1]: When Dr. Livingstone was found dead upon his knees in his tent in Africa, his native servant, thinking that he was engaged in prayer, exclaimed, 'The white man is holding communion with his God.'
