# 128 The Anglican Principle as to the Truth.

to this principle, the English Church appeals
to-day. In the words of Dr. Pusey "The
Church of England has, from the Reformation,
held implicitly, in purpose of heart, all which
the ancient Church ever held."[^1] That this is
the Anglican position, is abundantly evident.
Amongst such evidence, we may quote the
canon of Convocation which imposed subscrip-
tion to the Articles upon the clergy, in Eliza-
beth's reign. This canon directs preachers "to
be careful that they never teach ought in a
sermon, to be religiously held and believed by
the people, except what is agreeable to the
doctrine of the Old and New Testaments, and
what the Catholic fathers and ancient bishops
have collected out of the same doctrine." To-
gether with Holy Scripture, the Church of
England preserves and teaches the three Creeds,
—the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and
the Creed of St. Athanasius. The ground upon
which she bids us accept them, is, that "they
may be proved by most certain warrants of
Holy Scripture."[^2] It is a striking proof of our
claim to orthodoxy, that we alone, of the whole
Catholic Church, recite the Athanasian Creed in
the public services of the Church. This Creed
commences with the assertion, that "whosoever
will be saved, before all things it is necessary
that he hold the Catholic Faith."

The English Church also recognizes the
authority of the undisputed General Councils.[^3]
