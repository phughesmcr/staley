# The Ministry of the Church. 21

ordained, rests upon the permanent character of
his Incarnation.

Our Lord intended that the office which He
bestowed upon the twelve apostles should live
on, after their deaths, as long as the world lasts.
The apostolic ministry is an abiding fact in
a world of change.

It is true that the commission,—"Go ye
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded you,"
was given to the apostles; but it was accom-
panied by the promise,—"Lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world."[^1] This
promise was not primarily addressed to all
Christian people, but only to the apostles,[^2] and
that too in connection with the official acts of
teaching and baptizing. It is as though Christ
had said,—Teach and baptize all nations, and
I will be with you in so doing. Moreover, He
promised to be with the apostles in performing
these ministerial acts "unto the end of the
world." But how could He be with the apostles
personally in their work "unto the end of the
world?" He knew that the apostles would die
like other men, and therefore the promise of
being with them as individuals "unto the end
of the world," could not be our Lord's meaning.

"The end of the world," of which our Lord
spake, has not yet come; how then is his
promise to the apostles fulfilled?
