# 338 The Holy Bible.

in the Sacred Books, and which appear so
entirely to absorb the attention of a merely
literary observer, a deeper insight will discover
in Scripture such manifest unity of drift and
purpose, both moral and intellectual, as to imply
the continuous action of a Single Mind." [^1]

To this passage we may add the further
words of Dr. Liddon, "In the Bible we handle
the masterpiece of the Holy Spirit set forth in
human speech." [^2]

## II. THE CONTENTS OF THE BIBLE.

The Bible appears to be one book, but it is
in reality many books bound together in one
volume. In the fourth century it was called
by the Latins 'the Divine Library,' and by the
Greeks 'the Books.' We often speak of it as
'the Holy Scriptures,' i.e., the holy writings.
The Bible was not written at one time, by one
author, and in one place; but it was written at
various times, by many persons, and in various
places.

There are three main divisions of the Holy
Bible, namelyâ€”

i. THE OLD TESTAMENT.
ii. THE ECCLESIASTICAL BOOKS,
   or APOCRYPHA.[^3]
iii. THE NEW TESTAMENT.

[^3]: The title 'Apocrypha' is a short form of the Greek for 'hidden' or 'secret books.' How it came to be applied to the Ecclesiastical Books is uncertain.
