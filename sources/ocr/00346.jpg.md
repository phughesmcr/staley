# The Christian Course. 327

Because a man is once converted, it does not
follow that he is safe. A converted man may
fall from his state of grace and salvation, and
become a backslider, and so need converting
again. St. Paul was undoubtedly converted on
the road to Damascus, yet he often speaks as
though conscious of the possibility of falling
away.[^1]

Conversion, like Repentance, is not a solitary
act, but a lifelong, continual process, a daily
passing from death unto life, under the influence
of the grace of God. For not until the will of
man corresponds completely and perpetually
to the will of God, will Conversion be really
effectual. "He that endureth to the end shall
be saved."[^2]

## V. Justification.

Justification is the act of God upon the soul
whereby He cleanses it, and endows it with
righteousness by uniting it to Christ. Christ

time the soul is drawn to God, or previous drawings are
sensibly deepened. They vary in degree from the gentle
quickenings of a life-long piety, to the violent revolutions
which take place in souls who are as brands plucked out of
the burning. Such seasons can never be forgotten; they
stand out prominently as landmarks in our course, on which
alone the light of heaven seems to be shining, filling up
the whole retrospect, and shutting out the intervening
experiences of the soul. In all such cases there have been,
doubtless, secret preparations of the heart, leading on, and
opening the way to these critical seasons. But the eye of
the soul rests only on these great points in its history, and
they did, in fact, determine its conversion."â€”*Sermons*,
