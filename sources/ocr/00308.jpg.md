# The Sacraments. 291

of God's word, and open his grief; that by the
ministry of God's holy word he may receive the
benefit of absolution, together with ghostly coun-
sel and advice, to the quieting of his conscience,
and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness."

The gift of Absolution proceeds from our
Lord Jesus Christ. He "hath left power tc
his Church to absolve all sinners who truly
repent and believe in him." The Church so
realizes this truth, that, in admitting men to
the order of the priesthood, she dwells very
specially upon it. In the English Church every
priest is admitted to his sacred office by the
bishop, who lays his hands upon the priest's
head saying,â€”"Receive the Holy Ghost, for
the office and work of a priest in the Church
of God, now committed unto thee by the
imposition of our hands. Whose sins thou
dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose
sins thou dost retain, they are retained. And
be thou a faithful dispenser of the word of
God, and of his holy sacraments; in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen."[^1]

The Prayer Book speaks three times of the
power of Absolution. In Morning and Evening
Prayer there is a declaration of this power;
in the Communion Service a still stronger ex-
pression of it is found; but in the Order for
the Visitation of the Sick, we have the form
for the actual exercise of the power of Ab-
solution. This last is a most solemn and
direct assurance of pardon, since it can only
be pronounced after a full confession of sins
before the priest.
