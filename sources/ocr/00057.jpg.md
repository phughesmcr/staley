# The Ministry of the Church. 37

is false doctrine obstinately held or taught. The
true faith was revealed by Christ and his Holy
Spirit to the apostles in all its completeness.
The apostles handed down this body of teaching
to their successors, the bishops. By this means
the true faith was to be preserved in the world.
St. Paul alludes to this mode of handing down
the truth in his words to Timothy, the first
bishop of Ephesus. He writes,—" Hold fast
the form of sound words, which thou hast heard
of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
That good thing which was committed unto thee
keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us."¹
" The things that thou hast heard of me among
many witnesses, the same commit thou to faith-
ful men, who shall be able to teach others
also."² St. Paul is speaking of the deposit of
Christian truth, which was entrusted to Timothy,
as a bishop, to uphold and to guard.

St. Irenæus (A.D. 175), in speaking of the
succession of bishops in the local Church of
Rome, says,—"The blessed apostles (St. Peter
and St. Paul), then having founded and built
up this Church, committed the ministry of the
episcopate to Linus. Of this Linus, Paul
makes mention in the Epistle to Timothy.
Anacletus succeeds him. After him, in the
third place from the apostles, Clement obtained
the episcopate, who had both seen the blessed
apostles, and been with them, and still had the
preaching of the apostles ringing in his ears,
and their tradition before his eyes."³ St.
Irenæus, in speaking of Polycarp, goes on to

[^1]: 2 Tim. i. 13, 14.

sermon, *The Rule of Faith*, p. 65.
