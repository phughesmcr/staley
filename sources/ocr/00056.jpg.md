# 36 The Ministry of the Church.

example, St. Ignatius (A.D. 110), the great and
glorious martyr, bishop of Antioch, and a disciple
of the Apostle St. John, wrote,—"He who does
anything apart from the bishop, and presbytery,
and deacons, is not pure in his conscience."[^1]
"For as many as are of God and of Jesus
Christ, they are with the bishop."[^2] St. Ignatius
is but enlarging upon the teaching of the New
Testament, where the continuing in "the
apostles' doctrine and fellowship,"[^3] is named as
a mark of Church unity.

In the writings of Tertullian (A.D. 200), we
learn that certain bodies claiming to belong to
the Church were thus challenged,—"Let them
produce the account of the origins of their
churches; let them unroll the line of their
bishops, running down in such a way from the
beginning that their first bishop shall have had
for his authorizer and predecessor one of the
apostles, or of the apostolic men who continued
to the end in their fellowship."[^4]

St. Cyprian, bishop of Carthage and martyr
(A.D. 250), sets forth the unity of the episcopate
as the pledge of the unity of the Church. Of
his teaching we shall read in a later chapter of
this book.

Thus we see that in very early times, the
order of bishops was regarded as the bond of
unity in the Church.

As the guardian of the true faith, the episco-
pate is the guarantee against heresy. Heresy
