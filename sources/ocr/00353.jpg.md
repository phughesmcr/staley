# READING FROM THE GREAT BIBLE.

The first fully authorized version of the Bible in English, known as
'The Great Bible,' appeared in the year 1540. The Psalter, as now
printed in the Book of Common Prayer, is taken word for word from
'The Great Bible,' as are also the Ten Commandments and the
Comfortable Words in the Eucharistic Service. The Prayer Book
refers to this version of the Scriptures, in *the Order how the Psalter is
appointed to be read*, as 'The Great English Bible.'

On its appearance, 'The Great Bible' was ordered to be set up in
all the churches. Every parish priest was directed to 'provide one
book of the whole Bible, of the largest volume, in English, and have
the same set up in some convenient place within the church, whereat
the parishioners may most commodiously resort to the same, and
read it.' Copies of the Bible were then only provided at great cost;
and for their safe keeping, it was the custom to fasten them by chains
to pillars or desks in some accessible position in the churches. The
illustration represents one of these chained Bibles. In those days
the majority of people could not read, and it was not uncommon for
such persons to gather round the chained Bible in the churches,
whilst those who could, read aloud to the assembled hearers.
