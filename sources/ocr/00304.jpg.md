# The Sacraments. 287

us to overcome the temptations of the world,
the flesh, and the devil. Thus, by the Gift
of God bestowed through the Laying on of
Hands, our whole moral nature is rendered
capable of advance towards perfection, and
we are enabled to bring forth the fruits of the
Spirit.[^1]

In New Testament times, the administration
of Confirmation was accompanied by the be-
stowal of miraculous gifts, such as, for example,
the power to speak with tongues. These mi-
raculous or extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost
in Confirmation, are not to be confused with
his ordinary and abiding gifts in this sacrament.
The extraordinary gifts were for the benefit of
others, and not for the formation of holiness
in those who exercised them. The Church
teaches that, in the administration of the sacra-
ments, whatever concerns the welfare of souls
or the communication of grace, is ordinary and
abiding. Thus, whilst the extraordinary gifts
have ceased, the ordinary gifts are still bestowed
in the Laying on of Hands.

In the New Testament the sacrament of
Confirmation is closely associated with that
of Holy Baptism.

In Acts viii. 12, etc., we read a description
of the first occasion on which the Church of
Christ was extended beyond the gates of Jeru-
salem, and thus have an excellent example
of how beginners in the Christian religion were
then dealt with. St. Philip, a deacon, taught
and baptized the Samaritans, but the apostles

[^1]: "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffer-
ing, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance."â€”
Gal. v. 22, 23.
