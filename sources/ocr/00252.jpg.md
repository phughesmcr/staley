# The Commandments. 235

God's law is not an arbitrary law. It could
not have been other than it is, because the
distinction which it points out between right
and wrong is an eternal distinction, rooted in
the being of God himself. The moral law is a
reflection of the holy will of God. We are not
required to keep the Commandments merely
because He bids us, and for no other reason;
but there is a just and good cause for what He
enjoins, and for what He forbids. The whole
law of God by which we are bound, is contained
in the principle of love. "Love is the fulfilling
of the law."[^1] The Commandments are laid
down for our good; and the highest good to
which we can attain is to love God with all our
hearts, and to love our neighbour as ourselves.
We shew our love to God by keeping his Com-
mandments. If we break them, we can only
come to grievous harm: He has bidden us "to
keep the commandments of the Lord, and his
statutes, which I command thee this day for
THY GOOD."[^2] Our blessed Lord added,â€”"If
thou wilt enter into life, keep the command-
ments."[^3] The Ten Commandments form our
rule of life, they are as the hedges at the road
side, to keep us in the right path of the love of
God and man, and to save us from trespassing
on forbidden ground. Of the just man it is
written, "The law of his God is in his heart:
and his goings shall not slide.[^4] "He that hath
my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is
that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall
be loved of my Father."[^5]
