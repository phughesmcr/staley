## iv. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD.

1. We come now to the Burial Office, the last
office, excepting the continual remembrance of
the faithful departed in prayer and at the cele-
bration of the Holy Eucharist, which our
Mother Church performs on behalf of her
children. It concerns them as still members
of the same Body, though departed this life.
May we all so live that, at our departure, it
may be used for ourselves in all the confidence
of a holy hope!

2. The idea of the Burial Office is a high one.
It is framed for a Christian who has lived and
died in the faith, fear, and love of Christ, and
in full communion with his Church. Its general
tone is therefore very joyous. It has indeed its
sombre side in the psalms and in the first cry at
the grave; but in every other portion it seems
to say to the mourner, "Thy brother shall rise
again."

3. In all particulars, the gloom, which was
formerly considered so appropriate and was so
fashionable, should be carefully avoided.

4. Never, if possible, let the coffin be black.
Much more suitable designs for coffins may
now be had, than was the case formerly.

5. A praiseworthy determination is being
manifested throughout the country to cut down
unnecessary expenses, which, under the circum-
stances, are often found so burdensome. We
show the most real respect for the dead, when
we do what we believe is sensible and right,
even if at first we have to be somewhat singular
in paving the way for improvements.
