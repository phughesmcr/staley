## IV. THE COUNSELS OF PERFECTION.

The Counsels of Perfection are three in num-  
ber, viz., POVERTY, CHASTITY, and OBEDIENCE.  
They are termed 'counsels' as distinguished  
from the divine 'precepts,' the fulfilment of  
which is universally necessary to salvation.  
They are called Counsels of Perfection, because  
they are the means whereby the highest per-  
fection may be obtained by those who are called  
to follow Christ in this way. They are of the  
nature of exceptional sacrifices, and so form the  
rule, not for the many, but for the few,—for  
such as are "able to receive it."[^1]

In the Counsels of Perfection, Jesus Christ  
gave the rule of the higher life, founded upon  
his own most perfect life. Persons may be  
called to,—

Voluntary POVERTY, in imitation of him who  
"though He was rich, yet for our sakes became  
poor,"[^2] and who had "not where to lay his  
head,"[^3] and was among men as "He that  
serveth."[^4]

Voluntary CHASTITY, in imitation of him who  
was the virgin Son of a virgin Mother, and  
who lived a life of perfect chastity.

Voluntary OBEDIENCE, in imitation of him  
who "pleased not himself,"[^5] and who said,—  
"I came down from heaven, not to do mine  
own will, but the will of him that sent me."[^6]

i. POVERTY is the giving up of worldly goods,  
that the person may be free from worldly cares.  
It is the following of our Lord's advice to the
