# The Sacraments. 275

The Eucharist is the worship of almighty
God by the oblation of Christ, with all the
members of his body, the Church, in union with
him. As St. Augustine, speaking of Christ and
the Church, says,â€”"Whole Christ consisteth
of head and body." In offering the Eucharist
to the eternal Father, the oblation is not that
of Christ alone, but of the head with the mem-
bers. The words written of King Solomon and
his subjects, may be applied to the Eucharistic
Sacrifice, "The king, and all Israel with him,
offered sacrifice before the Lord."[^1] Thus the
offering of the Eucharistic Sacrifice is the
supreme act of Christian worship.

### iii. The Eucharistic Feast,

commonly called

## The Holy Communion.

Our Lord Jesus Christ ordained the sacra-
ment of the Eucharist in order that we might
be able on earth to plead his sacrifice before the
face of God, even as He does in heaven. But
there was a further object of supreme importance,
namely, that He might feed our souls with his
sacred body and blood.

That we may thus be able to feed upon him,
He has given to his Church authority to con-
secrate, by the power of his Holy Spirit, bread
and wine to become his body and blood. When
we receive the bread and the wine thus con-
secrated, we verily and indeed receive the sacred
flesh and blood of Christ.

The certainty of this depends on the truth
