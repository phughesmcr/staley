# The Holy Bible. 349

Church, a guide to its meaning. In her Creeds,
and in the general sense of her great teachers,
we find a clue to the real unity and drift of
Scripture." [^1]

If, in answer to all this, the objection be
raised that the Church herself is not agreed as
to the meaning of certain passages of Holy
Scripture, we reply:—Differences of opinion
undoubtedly exist in the Church, but not in
regard to that which is necessary to salvation.
On minor points of interpretation there are
differences, but not as to main truths. In things
essential to the salvation of the soul, the Holy
Catholic Church all along the centuries has ever
spoken clearly and without contradiction. The
foundation truths of Christianity have been
accepted in the Church *Always, Everywhere,
and by All* (see page xvi.).

"When the Fathers say, We are to rely upon Scripture
only, they are never to be understood with exclusion of
Tradition, in what causes soever it may be had. Not but
that the Scripture is abundantly sufficient, in and to itself,
for all things, but because it is deep, and may be drawn into
different senses, and so mistaken, if any man will presume
upon his own strength, and go single without the Church."—
Archbishop Laud's *Conference with Fisher*, xvi. 33.
