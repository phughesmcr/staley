# Worship. 375

married in any other church: but the irregularity,
though contrary to law, would not invalidate
a marriage. One, however, can hardly imagine
thoughtful persons desiring to be married by
clergy who are strangers to them, and not by
their own pastors, at whose hands they receive
all other means of grace.

6. Care should be taken to break no rule of
the Church in the time chosen for marriages.
They should never take place in Lent: Advent,
because of its penitential character, is not a
desirable season. Fridays should, of course, be
avoided, and all other fast-days, such as the
vigils before festivals, the Ember and Rogation
Days. Before fixing the time, it is well to
consult a calendar; to see what days are un-
suitable. (See page 252.)

7. The old-fashioned mode of being married
by banns is best. The money saved by richer
people in not having to purchase a license,
might be put to excellent use,â€”as in gifts to
the poor.

8. The Church prefers that a wedding should
not be (as it were) in secret, as if the parties
were ashamed of it. She says, "they shall
come into the body of the church with their
friends and neighbours," that they may be
witnesses, and join in the prayers. Never-
theless, persons who prefer it may be married
with as much privacy as they please, providing
that no law is broken.

9. The wedding party, be it great or small,
should be composed of persons who are sure to
behave themselves with becoming seriousness.
