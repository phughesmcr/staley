# 218 The Faith of the Church.

where He listeth. All life is his in nature and
in man. There is no being which lies outside
the action of the eternal Word or his Spirit."ยน
Whilst it is true that God's grace overflows the
Church, yet the fact remains that it is *pledged*
to us only within that sphere. God's grace
is not bound, but we are bound to seek it where
He has promised it, that is, in the Church.
The Church is the circle wherein God chiefly
works. Within the Church, definite graces are
pledged and guaranteed by the divine fidelity.
Within the Church, the faithful Christian lives
and moves in the region of assured grace. There
is no covenanted security outside the Church.

This important truth is revealed by God in
the New Testament, and it is taught by the
position which the phrase "the Holy Catholic
Church," occupies in the Apostles' Creed.

## 3. The Notes of the Church.

From the Creeds we learn that the Church
possesses four notes, or distinguishing marks.
The Church is One, Holy, Catholic, and Apos-
tolic.

THE CHURCH IS ONE, for there is none other,
and because the faithful who form the Church
are united to one head, even Jesus Christ, by
the same sacraments. They hold the same
faith, and are subject to the same authority
exercised by the bishops, who represent Christ.
The unity of the Church is mainly an internal
unity, which ought to shew itself in an external
unity. Through the sin of man this external
unity has been broken.
