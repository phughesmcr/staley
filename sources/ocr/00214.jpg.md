# The Faith of the Church. 195

place or process of cleansing or purging ; ' it is
disused amongst us because of certain ideas
which in medieval times had attached them-
selves to the word. Of these we have already
spoken in discussing the causes of the Refor-
mation.

The subject of prayer for the departed will
be treated of later in this book (see pp. 224-
226, 272).

## 7. The Resurrection.

"The third day He rose again from the
dead."

The lifeless body of our Saviour was taken
down from the cross on the evening of Good
Friday by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus,
two of his disciples. The first of these was a
rich man who owned a garden in which he had
prepared for himself a tomb, hewn out of the
rock. To this unused sepulchre, the sacred
body of our Lord was carried. Before being
laid to rest, the lifeless form had been wound
in the long linen bandages used by the Jews in
burial, in the folds of which spices, to the weight
of a hundred pounds, had been placed for the
preservation of the body. The head of our
Lord was also wrapped round with a napkin,
leaving the lower part of the face and the neck
uncovered. It is important to notice these
arrangements, in regard to what afterwards
happened. Placing the sacred body of the
Lord in the cave, the two disciples rolled a
great stone to the opening, and departed.
