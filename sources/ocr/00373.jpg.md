# Worship.

### iii.

In speaking upon this subject Dr. Liddon wrote,—" Religion, in order to meet the wants of human nature, will take account of each element in man's nature: she will maintain lower relations with the bodies as well as higher relations with the souls of men. As man has, besides his unseen person, an outward and visible shape, so will religion herself provide sensible forms as well as supersensuous realities. She will exact outward as well as inward reverence, because in a being constituted like man, the one is really the condition of the other. There are bodily postures which absolutely forbid heavenly exercises to the soul: to lounge in an arm-chair is inconsistent with the tension of thought and will which belongs to adoration of the Most Holy.[^1] Religion, like man himself, is a beautiful spirit tabernacling in a body of sense. Her divine and immutable truths are shrouded beneath the unrivalled poetry of Bible language; her treasures of grace beneath the outward and visible signs which meet us in sacraments. She proclaims the invisible by that which meets the eye; she heralds the eternal harmonies by a music that falls upon the ear. She certainly is not all form, for man is not a brute: but also she is not all spirit, for man is not an angel. She deals with man as being precisely what he is,

[^1]: "The reverence of the soul is best secured when the body, its companion and instrument, is reverent also. To see God is to feel it to be an imperious necessity to prostrate ourselves before him. 'O come, let us worship and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker' (Ps. xcv. 6), is the voice of true reverence for all time."—Liddon, *Easter Sermons*, xxviii. p. 158.
