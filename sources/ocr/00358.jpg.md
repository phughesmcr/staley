# The Holy Bible. 339

## i. THE OLD TESTAMENT. The word *testa-*
*ment*, means 'covenant,' or 'agreement.' The
Old Testament contains the covenant which
God made with his ancient people, the Jewish
Church. Our blessed Lord spoke of the three
divisions of the Old Testament under the
names of "the Law of Moses, the Prophets,
and the Psalms."[^1] Of these we will now
speak.

(1) *The Law of Moses.* This portion of the
Old Testament contains the first five books of
the Bible, commonly known as the Pentateuch.
The word signifies 'the five-fold volume.' The
Pentateuch consisted of a single roll divided
into sections, and, for a long time, formed the
Canon[^2] of Jewish Scripture. The five sections
of the Pentateuch are known by the names,
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deu-
teronomy. The word *Genesis*, means 'origin,'
and in this book we learn the story of the origin
of the world. The word *Exodus*, means 'going
out,' for in this book we are told of the deliverance
of God's people from the Egyptian bondage.
The word *Leviticus*, signifies 'pertaining to the
tribe of Levi,' and the book gives the details
of the priestly duties, and the laws of sacrifice.
In the book *Numbers*, we find the census of the
chosen people. The word *Deuteronomy*, means
'the second law,' and in this book we find the
repetition or summary of the Law of God.

The Pentateuch is followed by the Historical
Books of the Old Testament, giving the history
of the chosen people.

[^1]: St. Luke xxiv. 44.
[^2]: By the term 'Canon of Scripture,' we mean the collec-
tion of writings declared by the Church to be inspired.
