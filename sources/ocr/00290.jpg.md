# The Sacraments. 273

refers to the erroneous idea that it was the
*number* of Masses which was the source of
benefit to the departed. For example, a med-
ieval legend represents a certain bishop hearing
a soul in purgatory say, that he should be
delivered from torments, if, for thirty days fol-
lowing, the bishop would say thirty Masses for
him.[^1] The idea condemned is that of the value
of *many* Masses, as separate acts of sacrifice
independent of the sacrifice of the cross; in
contradistinction to the truth, that each Mass
is but a continuous memorial and representation
of the one sacrifice, deriving all its power from
that one sacrifice. The idea condemned is that
of cumulation and repetition, independent of the
one and only availing sacrifice of Calvary.

The Sacrifice of the Mass, or Eucharistic
Sacrifice, understood in its ancient and Catholic
sense as "the continual remembrance of the
sacrifice of the death of Christ,"[^2] the English
Church has never disowned. In fact she could
not disown it, without forfeiting her claim to be a
portion of the Holy Catholic Church of Christ.

The word Mass, which is of uncertain origin,
was retained in the first reformed Prayer Book,
published in Edward the VI.'s reign. In that
book the title of the Eucharistic Service ran,â€”
"The Supper of the Lorde, and the Holy Com-
munion, commonly called the Masse." There
is an objection in many minds to the use of this
term, from its association with the errors to
which we have referred. But the name is
ancient, being used by St. Ambrose as far back
as the year 385, long before the Catholic doc-
