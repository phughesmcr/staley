# 330 The Christian Course.

glorified. "Whom He justified, them He also
glorified." [^1]

The grace of God is given to make us holy,
and so to fit us for God's presence in eternity;
for "without holiness no man shall see the
Lord." [^2] In Holy Baptism we are born again
into a state of Justification, that we may be
completely renewed. This renewal depends
upon our union with Christ, the Source of
holiness. Our union with Christ,—commenced
in Baptism, and dependent upon the abiding
presence of the Holy Spirit in the soul,—is
sustained by feeding upon him in the Holy
Communion of his body and blood.

We are responsible to God for the use we
make of the opportunities of Sanctification,
which never fail to wait on the regenerate and
justified. If we fail to use these great oppor-
tunities, then our Justification, like the pound
laid up in a napkin and unused, becomes a
witness against us in the day of judgment.
God's manifold dealings with us, in grace and
providence, are the means by which the Holy
Spirit,—our wills co-operating,—carries on, and
perfects the work of Sanctification.

Sanctification is the consecration of the re-
deemed man, with all the powers of his soul
and body, to the perfect and eternal service
of God. "Christ loved the Church, and gave
himself for it: that He might sanctify and
cleanse it with the washing of water by the
word, that He might present it to himself a
glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle,
or any such thing; but that it should be holy
and without blemish." [^3]
