# 260 The Sacraments.

the visible signs in Baptism and the Lord's Supper are : and
therefore Absolution is no such sacrament as Baptism and
the Communion are. And though the Ordering of Ministers
hath this visible sign and promise, yet it lacks the promise of
remission of sin, as all other sacraments besides do. There-
fore neither it, nor any other sacrament else, be such
sacraments as Baptism and the Communion are."—*Homily
of Common Prayer and Sacraments.*

"The proper and certain sacraments of the Christian
Church, common to all, or (in the words of our Church)
*generally necessary* to salvation, are but two, Baptism and
the Supper of the Lord . . . The rest we retain, though
not under the notion of such proper and general sacraments,
—as Confirmation, Ordination, Matrimony, Penitence, and,
lastly, the Visitation of, and Prayer for, the Sick."—Arch-
bishop Bramhall, *Works*, i. pp. 55, 56.

"It is none of the doctrine of the Church of England, that
there are two sacraments only, but that 'two only are
generally necessary to salvation.'"—Bishop Jeremy Taylor,
*Dissuasive., of Traditions*, Section iii.

## I. Holy Baptism.

In our Lord's conversation with Nicodemus,
recorded in St. John iii., He declared a new
birth of water and of the Spirit to be a necessity
to entrance into his kingdom. Our Lord re-
ferred to the sacrament of Baptism, which had
been foreshadowed in his own Baptism, and
which He was about to institute before his
ascension in the charge given to the apostles,
—"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."[^1]

Holy Baptism is the initial act of God upon
the soul, whereby it is transferred from a
natural condition to a state of grace. Hence,
it is called by Jesus Christ, the New Birth.

[^1]: St. Matt. xxviii. 19.
