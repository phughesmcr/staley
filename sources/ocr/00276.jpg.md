# The Sacraments. 259

The Church of England does not teach that
there are two Sacraments only; but that there
are "two only, as generally (or universally)
necessary to salvation." The five lesser Sac-
raments she also acknowledges, but not as
generally necessary to salvation. These lesser
Sacraments are not on this account to be set
aside as of no importance; for they are, in their
degree, visible signs of invisible grace, and form
part of the divine plan for our safety and per-
fection, according to our needs or conditions in
life.

NOTE ON THE NUMBER OF THE SACRAMENTS.

"In the earliest ages, Baptism and the Eucharist—the two
sacraments most clearly and directly instituted by Christ,
and most necessary for all—were classed together. Then
Confirmation, long given along with Baptism, was added to
the number. Next—as this number of three did not seem to
rest on any fixed principle—various writers chose various rites
of the Church and put them together under the common
name of *sacramenta*. At last, theological reflection, just
when systematic theology was beginning to be, led Peter
Lombard (A.D. 1164) to the conclusion that there were
seven rites, with this in common, which separated them
from all others—viz., that they were the ordained means of
grace. He called them, and them only, sacraments."—
Addis and Arnold, *Catholic Dictionary*, 4th ed., p. 800.

"As for the number of the sacraments, if they should be
considered according to the exact signification of a sacrament
—namely, for the visible signs expressly commanded in the
New Testament, whereunto is annexed the promise of free
forgiveness of our sins, and of our holiness and joining in
Christ—there be but two ; namely, Baptism, and the Supper
of the Lord. For although Absolution hath the promise of
forgiveness of sin, yet by the express word of the New
Testament it hath not this promise annexed and tied to the
visible sign, which is imposition of hands. For this visible
sign—I mean laying on of hands—is not expressly com-
manded in the New Testament to be used in Absolution, as
