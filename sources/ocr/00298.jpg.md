# The Sacraments. 281

deliverance from death was sealed by our Lord's
resurrection, which took place early in the
morning; and it is therefore fitting that we
should celebrate the Christian Passover at the
time He rose.[^1]

It is true that for a few years after the
Ascension, the Eucharist was celebrated in the
evening, and in connection with a social meal
named the Agape, or Lovefeast; we know for
certain that this was so at Corinth. But the
abuses connected with these evening Com-
munions were so grievous, that the Church
soon discouraged them, insisting on the custom
that the body and blood of Christ should be
received by those only who were fasting. It
was thought fitting that the heavenly food of
the soul should be received before the earthly
food of the body. The rapidity with which
the change was accomplished, and its universal
acceptance, lead to the conclusion that it was
made on the authority of the apostles themselves.
Whilst the hour of celebrating on Sundays and
festivals was early in the morning, it was later
on fast days, sometimes being as late as 3 o'clock
in the afternoon; but on every occasion, late
as well as early, none but fasting communions
were made.

Sunday evening Communion never existed

[^1]: St. Cyprian, writing A.D. 253, gives a reason why the
Holy Eucharist was celebrated in the morning, rather than
in the evening when Christ instituted it. He says,—"It
behoved Christ to offer at the evening of the day, that the
very hour of sacrifice might imitate the setting and evening
of the world, as it is written in Exodus, 'And the whole
assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the
evening' (xii. 6). But we celebrate the resurrection of the
Lord in the morning."—*Ep*. lxiii. 13.
