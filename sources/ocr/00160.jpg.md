# The Faith of the Church. 141

Church's warning to those who wilfully reject
the truth which God has made plain.

Creed of the Saints, and Anthem of the Blest,
And calm-breathed warning of the kindliest love,

*****

Who knows but myriads owe their endless rest
To thy recalling, tempted else to rove?

J. KEBLE.

Such is a brief account of the three Creeds,
which come to us on the authority of the Church,
and which "may be proved by most certain
warrants of Holy Scripture" (Art. viii.).

THE CREEDS.

## The Creed of St. Athanasius.

Whosoever will be saved : before all things it is necessary
that he hold the Catholick Faith.

Which Faith except every one do keep whole and un-
defiled : without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.

And the Catholick Faith is this : That we worship one
God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;

Neither confounding the Persons : nor dividing the Sub-
stance.

For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son :
and another of the Holy Ghost.

But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, is all one : the Glory equal, the Majesty
co-eternal.

Such as the Father is, such is the Son : and such is the
Holy Ghost.

The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate : and the Holy
Ghost uncreate.

The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible :
and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible.

The Father eternal, the Son eternal : and the Holy Ghost
eternal.

And yet they are not three eternals : but one eternal.

As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three
uncreated : but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.
