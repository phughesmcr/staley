## The Faith of the Church.

they recognized him.[^1] He suddenly appeared
in the room in which the apostles were sitting
with barred doors, without those doors being
opened.[^2] It was on the occasion of this appear-
ance, that Jesus gave to all the apostles the
power of forgiving sins in his name,[^3] which He
had previously promised to St. Peter at Cæsarea
Philippi.[^4] He was the same, yet not the same,
for He was clothed in the spiritual body of the
Resurrection. Such were the signs of the
marvellous properties of his risen body, in
which, to crown all, at the appointed time He
ascended into heaven.

### 9. The Ascension.

"He ascended into Heaven."

During the great forty days our Lord mani-
fested himself to the apostles from time to time.
He did not abide with them constantly as
before, but only came to them at intervals, and
for brief periods. There was much uncertainty
about his presence: his appearances and his
disappearances were alike startling. Before his
death He taught the disciples that the time
would come when He would leave them in
bodily presence. He had said,—"It is ex-
pedient for you that I go away."[^5] "A little
while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a
little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to
the Father."[^6] "I leave the world, and go to
the Father."[^7]
