# Worship. 377

most appropriate head-dress. Since a bishop
or priest only can bless authoritatively, a deacon
should never be asked to perform the marriage
ceremony.

15. After this blessing comes the second part
of the service, which, as it implores the graces
needed for the married state, may be called the
more sacramental portion. It is to be said in
the chancel, and is commenced by a psalm,
which "the Minister or Clerks shall say or
sing," as they pass up to the altar. It is one
of the occasions on which the Church authorizes
processional singing.

16. After the prayer there is a second bless-
ing, as beautiful as the first.

17. The whole office may be closed, either by
an address, which need consist of no more than
a few words of advice, or by the appointed
recitation of Scriptural counsel to married
people.

18. The final rubric is, "It is convenient
(that is, *suitable*) that the new-married persons
should receive the Holy Communion at the
time of their marriage, or at the first oppor-
tunity after their marriage." If there be a
celebration of the Holy Eucharist at the time,
the short sermon would naturally come after
the Nicene Creed. But none should com-
municate at a wedding except such of the
friends as have given in their names before-
hand, and only *before* the wedding-breakfast.
Or a celebration of the Holy Eucharist might
be arranged for an earlier hour than the actual
marriage service.
