4. It is seemly that the father should be
present.

5. Sponsors should, strictly speaking, be
communicants. It is of no use to bring, for
sponsors, persons who are not confirmed, or
are not Church people, or lead bad lives, or are
not likely to pray for those for whom they
answer at the font. By the sanction of the Con-
vocation of Canterbury, parents are allowed to
stand for their own children.

6. It should be understood that sponsors do
not answer for themselves, but for the children.
Baptism is a covenant, and both God and the
children make an agreement: but, because the
children cannot speak or understand, their
sponsors speak for them.

7. Members of the Church perform a great
act of charity when they undertake the spon-
sorial office; and if they cannot otherwise
benefit their charges, they can always pray for
them. "O God, bless my God-children," is
soon said, but it may effect very much. And
occasionally, if not constantly, they may be
more specially brought before God by name.

8. At the font the sponsors should give the
answers firmly, without being told to do so.

9. When the priest says, "Name this child,"
not only the person who holds it, but all the
sponsors should very distinctly pronounce the
Christian name, for which purpose they should
always be told the name beforehand. The
surname, or family name, should never be
pronounced; the child does not want that name
giving, for it comes into the world with it.
