# 158 The Faith of the Church.

which all things are alike possible. For it is
not more possible to him to create a worm
than an angel, nor more impossible to stretch
out the heavens than a leaf."[^1]

## 2. The Creation of the Angels.

The highest beings in the scale of creation
are the angels. Their existence and work in
the universe is abundantly testified by Holy
Scripture, and the teaching of the Church. The
angels are spiritual beings, created certainly
before man, if not before matter. The word
*angel* means 'messenger,' but this was not their
first name, for at their creation there were none,
so far as we know, to whom they could act
as messengers. Their first name was "sons
of God," and under this title they are described
as wondering spectators of the creation of the
world.[^2] In the epistle to the Hebrews,[^3] they
are spoken of as "ministering spirits (literally,
'spirits of worship') sent forth to minister for
them who shall be heirs of salvation." From
this passage we learn that their work consists
in the worship of God, and in the service of
men. The angels are moral agents, that is to
say, they possess freewill, and are able to choose
between good and evil.

There are intimations in Holy Scripture of
various orders or ranks in the angelic hosts.
These are generally supposed to be nine in
number, and are thus named:â€”

1. SERAPHIM.    Isaiah vi. 2, 6.
2. CHERUBIM.    Gen. iii. 24. Ps. xviii. 10.
