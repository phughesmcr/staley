duing in us what is evil, and quickening in us
what is good. And thus our spiritual life grows,
our union with Christ is more closely knit, and
his likeness formed within our souls. With

in us the seed of our immortality, the seed of
that spiritual body into which our natural body

Knox, p. 95. (See *Remains*, vol. ii. p. 163.) This testi-
mony of Bishop Overall to the teaching of the Church of
England on the subject of the Real Presence is important.
The conclusion of the Catechism, which treats of the Holy
Communion, should be read side by side with what he
says above, for it was compiled by him.
