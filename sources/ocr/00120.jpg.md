will proceed to treat them more fully in the
following chapters.

"I make not the least doubt in the world, but that the
Church of England before the Reformation and the Church of
England after the Reformation are as much the same Church,
as a garden, before it is weeded and after it is weeded, is
the same garden ; or as a vine, before it be pruned and after
it is pruned and freed from luxuriant branches, is one and
the same vine."—Archbishop Bramhall's Works, i. 2.

"The Church of England hath not changed one thing of
what she held before (the Reformation), any way pertaining
either to the being or well-being of a Church. She still re-
tains the same common rule of faith. She still teacheth the
necessity of a holy life, and presseth good works as much as
before. She still observes all the fundamental ordinances
and institutions of Christianity. She baptizeth, she feeds
with the Holy Eucharist, she confirmeth. She retaineth
the same apostolical government of bishops, priests, and
deacons."—Bishop Bull's Vindication of the Church of
England, xxvi.
