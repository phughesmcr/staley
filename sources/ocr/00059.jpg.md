# The Ministry of the Church. 39

and his Spirit be vouchsafed "alway," and "for
ever," but to the successors of the apostles, the
bishops of the Church.

It is also to be observed that the idea of
*teaching* is specially connected with both these
passages. Our Lord's presence is guaranteed
to the apostles and the bishops in "teaching
the nations to observe all things whatsoever
I have commanded you;"¹ the Holy Spirit will
be with them "for ever" as "the Spirit of
truth."² The same blessed Spirit who revealed
the truth to the apostles enabled their successors
to witness to that truth.

When heresy sprang up, it was exposed and
rejected by the bishops, acting alone or in council.
The Councils were great assemblies of bishops
of the Church. In these Councils, the bishops
declared the true faith as it had been handed
down to them from the apostles. They restated
the old faith from the beginning, as they had
received it.

As an example of this, we may instance the
heresy of Arius, who denied the Godhead of
our Saviour. Three hundred and eighteen
bishops met in council at Nicæa in the year
325, and condemned the heresy, by declaring
the truth which they had received through their
predecessors from the apostles. "So have we
received" was the witness they bore. We have
their statement of faith in the Nicene Creed,
which attests, with all possible fulness, the
Divine Nature of our Lord Jesus Christ. This
decision was received by the whole Church, and
thus we are certain that it has the authority of
the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of truth.
