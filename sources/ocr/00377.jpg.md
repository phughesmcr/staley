# 358 Worship.

to. The chief of these sources are: (1) The
First Prayer Book of Edward VI., (2) The
injunctions of Edward VI., (3) The lists of
ornaments which were made by the King's
instructions in 1552, for the survey of the
Church goods throughout the kingdom. The
Salisbury missal and other old Service-books,
which were in use during the whole of the year
in question,[^1] may also be consulted as throwing
light upon the authorities named above. For
instance, where an alb and chasuble are ordered
in the First Prayer Book of Edward VI., the
use of a girdle, amice, and stole, is implied;
since these accessories always accompanied the
alb and chasuble under the Salisbury missal.

From a long list, the following are selected:

## ORNAMENTS OF THE CHURCH.

The Altar, with its Candlesticks, Cross, and
    Coverings.
Paten and Chalice.
Cruets for wine and water.
Font.
Pulpit.

## ORNAMENTS OF THE MINISTERS.

The Eucharistic Vestments, viz.:
    Alb and Vestment, i.e., Chasuble, for the
        celebrant.
    Albs and Tunicles, for the assistants.
Cope.
Surplice.
Rochet, Pastoral Staff, and Mitre, for bishops.
