# 14 The Foundation of the Church.

he was 'primus inter pares,' i.e., first amongst equals. The
fathers lay great stress on the equality of the apostles.

If St. Peter is a rock upon which the Church is built,
we must remember that the other apostles are also spoken
of as foundations of the Church (see Eph. ii. 20 ; Rev. xxi.
14). The power of the keys, promised first to St. Peter,
was afterwards promised by our Lord to all the apostles in
similar words (compare St. Matt. xvi. 19 with xviii. 18);
and it was simultaneously communicated to all (St. Thomas
excepted) by our Lord's mysterious breathing, and by his
words of power, on the evening of the day of his resurrection
(see St. John xx. 21-24).
