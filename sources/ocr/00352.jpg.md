new birth in grace. God calls the soul to a
gradual progress of growing life. This growth
when truly maintained, through the Holy Spirit's
influence, under the discipline of life, is the
intended result of God's manifold dealings with
the soul, and such growth is the truest witness
to an assured redemption. But there may be
alternations of nature and grace, the one or the
other prevailing for the time: and there may
be fallings away, and even long periods of
decline. But there is a restorative power in
regenerating grace, and there is a fulness of life
promised to true repentance. There may be
"repentance unto life,"[^1] and "repentance to
salvation not to be repented of,"[^2] and a return
to God lasting for ever, with "hope as an
anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and
which entereth into that within the veil."[^3]
Our Lord has even said,â€”"Many that are first
shall be last; and the last shall be first,"[^4] for
"He is able also to save them to the uttermost
that come unto God by him, seeing He ever
liveth to make intercession for them."[^5] Thus,
all past loss may be repaired, and, as our Lord
assures us, "he that endureth to the end shall
be saved."[^6]

There is no limit to the possibilities of divine
grace, in souls made willing by the Holy Spirit
of God. But Final Perseverance implies a
stedfast continuance in well-doing, tried and
tested under the manifold changes and chances
of this mortal life.
