# The Sacraments. 285

the Prayer Book, first published in 1657, by
Bishop Sparrow (one of its revisers, and who
must be supposed to have known what was
intended), it is expressly said,—"This Sacra-
ment should be received fasting." Moreover,
the Church of England declares in the Preface
to the Prayer Book that she has no intention
of 'striking at any laudable practice of the
whole Catholic Church of Christ,'—and the
custom of fasting Communion is certainly such
a practice. An English Canon of 960 still
exists, never having been repealed, which runs,
—"We charge that no man take the housel
(the old English word for the Holy Communion)
after he hath broke his fast, except it be on
account of extreme sickness." [^1]

[^1]: Johnson's English Canons, vol. i. p. 419.

"The usual hour for the solemnity of the Communion
service was anciently nine of the clock, morning ; this is the
canonical hour. It is the most convenient hour for all to
meet, and despatch this with other offices before noon.
For, till the service was ended, men were persuaded to be
fasting ; and therefore it was thought fit to end all the
service before noon, that people might be free to eat."

"This Sacrament should be received fasting. And so
was the practice of the universal Church, says St. Augustine,
which is authority enough to satisfy any that do not love
contention."

"It was an ancient custom after burial to go to the Holy
Communion, unless the office were performed after noon.
For then, if men were not fasting, it was done only with
prayers."

Prayer*, pp. 195, 196 ; 218, 219 ; 285. The last edition
of this work which appeared in the Bishop's lifetime, was
published A.D. 1684, twenty-two years after the final re-
vision of the Prayer Book. From this edition the above
quotations are made.
