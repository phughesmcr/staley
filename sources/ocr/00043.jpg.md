# The Ministry of the Church. 23

ing on the divine power and authority which
Christ gave to the twelve, have never been
wanting. Such successors of the apostles are
with us now. The apostolic succession is the
link or bond which connects the Church of the
twentieth century with that of the first century.

In passing on the ministerial office to their
immediate successors, the apostles used the
laying on of hands. This ceremony signifies
the transfer of authority, and it gave its name
to the rite of ordination. Ordination is the
setting apart of men to be ministers of Christ.
The apostles laid their hands upon their suc-
cessors, and these successors in turn did the
same to others. There are several instances
of this method of passing on the ministerial
offices in the New Testament.[^1] What was
then done has been done ever since. Every
bishop, priest, and deacon, is now set apart
by the laying on of hands. By this means
there has been no break in the transmission
of the ministerial commission in the Church
of God, from the times of the apostles down
to our own day.[^2]

The greatest possible care has ever been taken
in this matter, to secure the true succession.

[^1]: See Acts vi. 6. 1 Tim. iv. 14 ; v. 22. 2 Tim. i. 6.
[^2]: "The Church has a principle of perpetuity imparted
to it by God through his promise, who is her head and lord.
Her succession of bishops mounts up by a golden chain,
link by link, to the apostles, with whom and with their
successors Christ promised to be always, even to the end
of the world."â€”Pusey's sermon, *The Church the Converter
of the Heathen*, p. 13.
