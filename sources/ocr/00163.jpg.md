# The Faith of the Church.

## 144

### The Apostles' Creed.

Suffered under Pontius  
Pilate, Was crucified, dead,  
and buried,  
He descended into hell ;  
The third day He rose  
again from the dead,  

He ascended into heaven,  
And sitteth at the right hand  
of God the Father Almighty;  
From thence He shall  
come to judge the quick  
and the dead.  

I believe in the Holy  
Ghost ;  

The Holy Catholick  
Church ;  
The Communion of Saints ;  
The Forgiveness of sins ;  

The Resurrection of the  
body,  
And the life everlasting.  
Amen.  

### COMPARISON OF THE The Nicene Creed.

And was crucified also for  
us under Pontius Pilate. He  
suffered and was buried,  

And the third day He rose  
again according to the  
Scriptures,  
And ascended into heaven,  
And sitteth on the right hand  
of the Father.  
And He shall come again  
with glory to judge both the  
quick and the dead : Whose  
kingdom shall have no end.  
And I believe in the Holy  
Ghost, The Lord, and Giver  
of life, Who proceedeth from  
the Father and the Son, Who  
with the Father and the Son  
together is worshipped and  
glorified, Who spake by the  
Prophets.  
And I believe One Catho-  
lick and Apostolick Church.  

I acknowledge one Bap-  
tism for the remission of sins,  
And I look for the Resur-  
rection of the dead,  
And the life of the world  
to come. Amen.
