"At the arrival of Augustine the monk, about six hundred
years after Christ, the Britons he found observers still of the
self-same government by bishops over the rest of the clergy;
under this form Christianity took root again, where it had
been exiled. Under the self-same form it remained till the
days of the Norman conqueror. By him and his successors
it hath from that time till now been upheld."â€”Hooker,
*Eccl. Polity*, vii. 2. 1.
