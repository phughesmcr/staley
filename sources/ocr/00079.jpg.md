# The Divisions in the Church. 59

Let us briefly consider the causes which led
to these lamentable divisions in the Church.

First, we will speak of the great and dis-
astrous division between East and West;—We
can trace the working out of this great rent in
the Church to various causes. Amongst these
we may instance the use of different languages.
The theological language of the East was
Greek, that of the West was Latin. As fresh
heresies arose, new words had to be coined to
state the truths assailed. It is not hard to see
what grave difficulties would arise in selecting
terms which, whilst they shut out error, con-
veyed the same meaning to persons of different
languages. Dr. Newman says,—"The diffi-
culties of forming a theological phraseology
for the whole of Christendom were obviously
so great . . . not only had the words to be
adjusted and explained which were peculiar
to different schools or traditional in different
places, but there was the formidable necessity
of creating a common measure between two,
or three languages,—Latin, Greek, and Syriac.
The intellect had to be satisfied, error had to be
successfully excluded, parties the most contrary
to each other, and the most obstinate, had to be
convinced."¹

A second and more serious cause of separation
between East and West, arose in reference to

Nicene Creed. This Creed, as its name shows,
was first drawn up by the General Council held
