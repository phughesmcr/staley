# 78 The Conversion of England.

there are others, of whom we must briefly speak,
who shared in the conversion of England.

The year before Aidan came to Northumbria,
a portion of England named Wessex received
the Christian faith at the hands of a missionary
named Birinus. His origin is uncertain, but we
know that he went to Rome, and on promising
to preach the gospel in parts of England which
had not yet been visited by any Christian
teachers, the bishop of Rome caused him to
be consecrated a missionary bishop. Birinus
became the first bishop of Dorchester, and
laboured with great success in heathen Wessex.

There is yet the name of another founder of
the Church in England to which we must refer,
that of Felix. Felix came from Burgundy with-
out any direct communication with Rome. He
was consecrated abroad, as Bishop of Dunwich,
a town on the coast of Suffolk, now covered
by the sea, where for twenty years he laboured
in the conversion of East Anglia. We have in
the town of Felixstowe a survival of his name.

It is upon the foundations laid by these and
such like holy men, that the English Church
is built. They are our Fathers in Christ, and
to them we owe a vast debt of gratitude.
