# 254 The Sacraments.

incarnation was a 'taking of the manhood into
God.' As He had no earthly father, so has
He no human personality. He is not a man
made God, but God made man."¹ Neither the
Bible nor the Creeds say that the Son of God
was made *a man*. The Gospel teaches us that
"the Word was made flesh," and the Nicene
Creed that He was "made man." The dis-
tinction is great and important. It was not *a
man*, but *manhood* that the Son of God united
to himself in the womb of the blessed Virgin
Mary. It was not *a human person*, but *human
nature* that He assumed in the Incarnation.²

When God said,—" Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness,"³ He was speaking
of the whole human race, as well as of the first
man. This is clear, for He added,—"and let
*them* have dominion." This is taught again in
Gen. v. 2, where we read,—"Male and female

[^2]: "'The Word,' saith St. John (i. 14) 'was made flesh,
and dwelt *in us*.' The evangelist useth the plural number
*us* for the nature whereof we consist. It pleased not the
Word of God to take to himself some one person amongst
men, for then should that one have been advanced and no
more. He made not this or that man his habitation, but
dwelt in us. The Son of God did not assume a man's
person unto his own, but a man's nature to his own person."
