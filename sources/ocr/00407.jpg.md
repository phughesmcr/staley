# 386 The XXXIX. Articles

principles, for the preservation of peace to be
subscribed, and not openly contradicted by her
sons. And, therefore, she requires subscription
to them only from the clergy, and not from the
laity."[^1]

"The Articles are to be subscribed to in the
sense intended by those whose authority makes
the subscription requisite."[^2] It must always
be remembered that the same Convocation, in
the same set of Canons which first required
subscription to the Articles, in 1571, enjoined
that preachers should only teach "that which
is agreeable to the doctrine of the Old and New
Testaments, and that which the Catholic fathers
and ancient bishops have collected out of the
same doctrine." "It seems" says Mr. Keble,
"no violent inference, that the appointed measure
of doctrine preached, was also intended to be
the measure of doctrine delivered in the way
of explanation of doubtful passages in formu-
laries."[^3]

It is quite evident, therefore that the Articles
would be understood by the clergy who first
subscribed them as Articles of Peace for the
preservation of unity. They were not religious
tests, or Articles of Faith; they were made as
comprehensive as possible, and they were to be
interpreted and understood in accordance with
the general rule of Catholic tradition, i.e., in the
Catholic sense.[^4]
