# The Commandments. 249

rich young nobleman,—"If thou wilt be perfect,
go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,
. . . and come and follow me." [^1] The apostles
embraced this 'counsel,' as we learn from the
words, "Behold, we have forsaken all, and
followed thee." [^2]

ii. CHASTITY in the abstaining from marriage,
or the continuance in holy widowhood, in the
spirit of our Lord's words,—"There be eunuchs,
which have made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to
receive it, let him receive it." [^3] To this state
St. Paul refers in the words, "He that is un-
married careth for the things that belong to the
Lord, how he may please the Lord. . . . The
unmarried woman careth for the things of the
Lord, that she may be holy in body and in
spirit." [^4]

iii. OBEDIENCE is the voluntary subjection of
the will to authority, in humble dependence upon
a religious rule recognized as the will of God. It
is the closest following of him who "took upon
him the form of a servant, . . . and humbled
himself, and became obedient unto death." [^5]

It is a wise plan for those whom God calls
to embrace the Counsels of Perfection, to
associate themselves, for greater support and
encouragement, in religious communities, such
as the brotherhoods or sisterhoods of the Church.
The revival of such communities of devoted
men and women amongst us, is a matter for
deep thankfulness.
