# The Faith of the Church.

Previous to leaving the earth in bodily pre-
sence, our Lord had met the eleven apostles
upon a mountain in Galilee, and there He
had delivered to them his final charge in the
majestic words, " All authority hath been given
unto me in heaven and on earth. Go ye
therefore, and make disciples of all the nations,
baptizing them into the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost:
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
I commanded you: and lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world."[^1] And
now, on the fortieth day after his resurrection,
the time came for his departure from earth
to heaven. Taking the eleven disciples with
him, He led them for the last time out of
Jerusalem, across the brook Kedron, to the
summit of Mount Olivet. Whilst stretching
out his hands in blessing, He rose slowly from
the earth, and ascended higher and higher, until
a bright luminous cloud enfolded him, and He
was lost to view. " It came to pass, while He
blessed them, He was parted from them, and
carried up into heaven."[^2]

Behind the cloud how wondrous must the
scene have been, for the gates of heaven were
lifted up, and the holy angels poured forth to
conduct their King, returning from his humilia-
tion, to the highest place of honour at the right
hand of the eternal Father! "He was received
up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of
God."[^3] The word 'sitteth' in the Creed, speaks
of the rest, dominion, and judgeship of our
ascended Lord.
