# 298 The Sacraments.

her members to ask God's guidance for the  
bishops in selecting fitting persons for the  
ministry of the Church, and his blessing upon  
such persons. Our Lord himself spent a whole  
night in prayer before choosing his apostles;¹  
and before St. Paul and St. Barnabas were  
sent forth, the Church fasted and prayed.²  
There are two prayers, provided by the Church,  
to be said every day in the Ember weeks; one  
of these we give below;—

ALMIGHTY God, our heavenly Father,  
who hast purchased to thyself an uni-  
versal Church, by the precious blood of thy  
dear Son; Mercifully look upon the same, and  
at this time so guide and govern the minds  
of thy servants the bishops and pastors of thy  
flock, that they may lay hands suddenly on  
no man, but faithfully and wisely make choice  
of fit persons to serve in the sacred ministry  
of thy Church. And to those which shall be  
ordained to any holy function give thy grace  
and heavenly benediction; that both by their  
life and doctrine they may set forth thy glory,  
and set forward the salvation of all men;  
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Sacrament of Holy Order, like Holy  
Baptism and Confirmation, imprints a mark  
or character upon those who receive it, which  
ever remains; and therefore ordination cannot  
be repeated.

Upon the subject of the ministry of the  
Church, we have already spoken fully in  
Chapter III. of the First Part of this book.
