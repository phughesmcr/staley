# The Sacraments. 267

partaken of by the communicants. This action
is termed by St. Paul, "shewing the Lord's
death."¹ In saying, "This do in remembrance
of me," our Lord used words which signify,—

It has often been shewn that the word here
translated 'do,' is frequently used in the Greek
version of the Old Testament for 'offer,' though
the Greek Fathers, with the exception of Justin
Martyr, treat the words "do this" as meaning
"perform this action."² In the following pass-
ages, to which the reader may refer for himself,
Ex. xxix. 36, 38, 39, 41, Lev. ix. 7, 16, 22;
xiv. 19; etc., the word translated 'offer' is the
same as that used by our Lord when He said,
"Do this."

The Greek word for 'remembrance' has a
distinctly sacrificial meaning. It is used but
twice in the Old Testament, and but four times
in the New. Three times in the New Testa-
ment, the reference is to the Holy Eucharist.
Let us examine the three remaining passages,
where the Greek word translated 'remembrance,'
is used apart from the Eucharist. By this
means we shall best discover our Lord's
meaning in speaking of this sacrament as his
'remembrance.'

In Lev. xxiv. 5-8, we read,—"And thou
shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes
thereof, . . . and thou shalt set them in
two rows . . . upon the pure table before
the Lord. And thou shalt put pure frank-
incense upon each row, that it may be on the
