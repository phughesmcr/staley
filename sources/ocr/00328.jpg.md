# Prayer. 309

Eucharist, Mattins, and Evensong. The Lord's
Prayer contains God's own statement of the
needs of man; and, in using it, we have divine
authority for believing that all we ask is accord-

ago, the bishops under King Canute beautifully
said,—'It contains a message to God regarding
every need a man may have, either for this life
or for that to come.'

The 'Our Father' consists of seven petitions,
which fall into one of two divisions, marked by
the use of the words Thy, and us and our. The
Prayer places God's glory first, and our needs
in the second place. The seven petitions may
be summarized thus:—

GOD'S GLORY.           MAN'S NEEDS.
*We pray for,*           *We pray for,*
1. Reverence.           4. Food.
2. Loyalty.             5. Forgiveness.
3. Obedience.           6. Guidance.
                        7. Deliverance.

The Lord's Prayer is the prayer of the
baptized. It addresses God as Father, and
thus can only be used by those who have been
made his children in Holy Baptism, and so
adopted into his family,—the Church. In the
early days of the Church, no unbaptized person
was permitted to say the 'Our Father.' Persons
under preparation for Holy Baptism were in-
structed in its meaning, as part of such prepar-
ation, and learnt it by heart the week preceding
baptism; but they were not allowed to use
