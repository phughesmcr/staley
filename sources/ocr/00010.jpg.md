# Preface.

Among the quotations made in this volume, those from
the writings of Dr. Pusey will be found to be numerous.
This has been done in the belief that from his great learning,
his fulness of exposition, and his untiring labours, he is the
most valuable witness to the Church's truth on the various
subjects which have been discussed among us of late years;
and these discussions have embraced a very wide range of
teaching.

I would add that definite doctrine, and a clear under-
standing of the truth, are of the utmost value in promoting
a consistent Christian life. What we do and are, greatly
depends on what we believe. Our life is the fruit of our
faith. And it is surely the first duty of Church-people to
learn, as fully and as clearly as they can, what the Church
teaches, and what faithful men have gathered from the
authorities to which the Church directs us.

That there may be a blessing on this work; that it may
be found helpful to those who are earnestly seeking to live
to God, and who "ask for the old paths, where is the good
way, and walk therein" that they may "find rest for their
souls," is the prayer and earnest desire of the undersigned.

T. T. CARTER.
