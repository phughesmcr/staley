# Anglican Orders. 107

on ritual, says,—"All the bishops who are
present are not only witnesses but also co-
operators, this is to be asserted beyond all
manner of doubt."¹ Thus, even if it were true
that Barlow was not consecrated, the defect
would have been made good by the bishops
who assisted him. The objection to Barlow's
authority rests on the fact that the record of
his consecration is missing in the register at
Lambeth. But this omission need cause no
uneasiness, for, at the period of which we are
speaking, there is evidence that the Lambeth
registers were most carelessly kept. During
the archiepiscopate of Cranmer, in whose time
Barlow would be consecrated, out of a total
of forty-five consecrations, eight other consecra-
tions are also omitted, besides five omissions
out of eleven translations from see to see. In
the case of Pole, the previous archbishop in
Mary's reign, three of his seven consecrators
have no records.

But though the particular record is wanting,
there is ample evidence that Barlow was con-
secrated; the various steps of his advancement
to the episcopate are clearly traceable, and good
evidence exists that he acted and was treated as
a bishop. As Dr. Lingard, a Roman Catholic
writer, observes,—"For ten years Barlow per-
formed all the sacred duties, and exercised all
the civil rights of a consecrated bishop; he took
his seat in Parliament as Lord Bishop of St.
David's. He ordained priests: he was one of
the officiating bishops at the consecration of
Bulkley."²
