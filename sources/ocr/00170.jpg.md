# The Faith of the Church. 151

sin, otherwise He would not be perfect. Nothing,
however trivial, happens independently of God;
not even a sparrow falls to the ground without
him.[^1] God is so powerful that He can create
worlds, and though his creatures have rebelled
against him, yet in the end "all things shall be
subdued unto him."[^2]

(e.) God is Omnipresent.

He is present everywhere, upholding, govern-
ing, and caring for all his creatures; seeing and
knowing all things, past, present, and future.
"He is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
of the heart; neither is there any creature that
is not manifest in his sight: but all things are
naked and opened unto the eyes of him with
whom we have to do."[^3]

(f.) "God is Love."[^4]

God never changes; as He is, so He has ever
been. He is, and ever has been love. Love is
of the very being of God. He can as soon cease
to exist, as He can cease to love. But love,
without an adequate object upon which to spend
itself, would exist as an unsatisfied desire. A
solitary deity would be but an imperfect being.
God was never alone, He is three persons in
one God from all eternity.

God is infinite love, and infinite love alone
can satisfy infinite love. It was out of love
that God created the universe. The love of
angels and men could not satisfy the love of
God, because their love is finite and imperfect.
