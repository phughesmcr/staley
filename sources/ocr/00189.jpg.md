# 170 The Faith of the Church.

God was not turned aside from his purpose of
uniting creation to himself; even though the
fall rendered his bitter death and passion a
necessity to our pardon and restoration. This
view exalts the Incarnation as an exhibition of
a love which not even man's sinful rebellion
could quench, though involving the incarnate
God in the added humiliation of suffering as
the fruit of our sins.

## 3. The Blessed Virgin Mary.

In the Incarnation of the Son of God, there
were two agents,â€”the one divine, the other
human. The divine agent was God the Holy
Ghost: the human agent was the blessed Virgin
Mary.

The blessed Virgin is said to have been the
child of Jewish parents named Joachim and
Anne. Of her birth and early life, Holy Scrip-
ture and history are alike silent. But we may
reverently believe that, with a view to her
future destiny as the mother of the Lord, she
was like the prophet Jeremiah,[^1] and the
Baptist,[^2] specially sanctified from the womb,
and that she lived a life of spotless innocence.
How could she otherwise have been fitted for
her high and mysterious office as the mother of
the incarnate God?

It was to the pure maiden of Nazareth, thus
chosen and prepared by God, that the angel
Gabriel came, bearing the offer from God of an
honour so amazing, that compared with it
every earthly honour is as nothing. The
angel's message was nothing less than that
