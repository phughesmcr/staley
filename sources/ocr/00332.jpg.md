# Prayer. 313

iv. "GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD."

This petition speaks of our dependence upon
God; for, in it, we pray for all things needful
for the welfare of soul and body.

We ask him for our food, and this day by
day. We are apt to take our food as a matter
of course, forgetting from whose hand it comes.
We must remember too that our food would not
nourish us apart from God's blessing. It is a
holy practice never to take our food without
first asking God to bless it to our use, and to
return thanks to him after meals.

But in this petition we pray also for the food
of our souls. Our Lord taught that the food of
the soul is of more importance than that of the
body, when He said,â€”"Labour not for the
meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life."[^1] He is refer-
ring to the Sacrament of his body and blood,
which He spoke of as the Bread of Life. They
who do not go to Communion, are not living as
they pray in this fourth petition.

v. "FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES, AS WE FOR-
   GIVE THEM THAT TRESPASS AGAINST US."

Our Lord meant us to use the 'Our Father'
daily: we learn this from the last petition,
which asks for daily bread. We are to pray
too for daily forgiveness; for, however good we
are, we never pass a day without falling into
some sin, however small. "A just man" saith

[^1]: St. John vi. 27.
