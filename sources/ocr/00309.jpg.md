# 290 The Sacraments.

saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And
when He had so said, He shewed unto them
his hands and his side. Then were the disciples
glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said
Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as
my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
And when He had said this, He breathed on
them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the
Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit, they
are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins
ye retain, they are retained." [^1]

By these words our Lord constituted the
apostles and their successors the ministers of
Absolution. "The power of remitting sins,"
says Bishop Sparrow,[^2] "was not to end with
the apostles, but is a part of the ministry of
reconciliation, as necessary now as it was
then, and therefore to continue as long as the
ministry of reconciliation, that is, to the end
of the world." The bestowal of the power to
'retain,' as well as to 'remit' sins in his name,
shews that our Lord intended the Church to
be the judge of the sinner's penitence. Further,
in order that this power may be exercised, it
is needful for the sinner seeking forgiveness
to open his heart by confession of sin. Such
a course, with a view to receiving Absolution,
is referred to in the exhortation before Com-
munion in the Prayer Book. The words are,
â€”"If there be any of you, who . . . cannot
quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth
further comfort or counsel, let him come to me,
or to some other discreet and learned minister
