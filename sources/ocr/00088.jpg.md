OUR LORD WITH ST. AUGUSTINE AND ST. AIDAN.

This illustration is a reproduction of the seal of the Church
House, thus described by Archbishop Benson:â€”"The figure
of our Lord, taken from one of the most beautiful pictures
of Fra Angelico, stands with parted arms upon a rock. From
the rock flow out four streams of Paradise into the ocean
of the great world. Below him, still on his own rock, stand
two great spiritual forefathers of England, St. Aidan, in his
Celtic dress, and St. Augustine." The design "thus com-
memorates Christ's two apostles, sent to our race amid the
great world with the blessing of his outspread hands."
