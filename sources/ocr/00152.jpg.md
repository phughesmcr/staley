# CHRISTIAN DUTY.

IN the previous part of this book, we have
striven to give, in general outline, a truth-
ful account of the English Church from its
foundation by St. Augustine, St. Aidan, and
their fellow missionaries, to its issue from the
Reformation. Since that time, although there
have been great movements within the Church,
yet there has been no change in its constitution.
We have established the position of the English
Church from its beginning down to the present,
as a true and living portion of the Holy Catholic
Church of Jesus Christ.

Having established our position, we will
proceed to consider our duties as Catholic
Christians. We will pass on to learn what,
as members of the Church, we are bound to
believe and to do.

The Church being the covenanted sphere
of divine grace and truth, it is our duty to
seek safety to our souls within its fold. But
it need hardly be said that mere membership
in the Catholic body will not avail to our
salvation, unless we believe truly and act
faithfully.

In Holy Baptism, we were made members of
the Church of Christ, and on receiving that
sacrament we made certain promises.
