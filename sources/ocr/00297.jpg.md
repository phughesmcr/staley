# 280 The Sacraments.

## iv. Fasting Communion.

To receive the Holy Communion before
taking any other food or drink, has been the
custom of the whole Church from the earliest
times. It is true that our Lord instituted the
Sacrament of his body and blood in the evening,
at the conclusion of the Jewish Passover. But
the Passover was not an ordinary meal; it was
the most solemn sacrifice of the Jewish Church.
Moreover, both our Lord and his apostles were
fasting when they received it, in accordance
with the custom which ordered that "from the
time of the evening sacrifice, nothing was to
be eaten till the Paschal Supper, so that all
might come to it with relish."[^1] The Holy
Communion is the Christian Passover, a feast
following a sacrifice, and therefore it was fitting
that it should be *instituted* at the conclusion of
the last of the long series of Jewish Passovers.
Whilst we are bound to copy our Lord closely
in the great features of the first celebration of
the Holy Eucharist (such as in the use of bread
and wine, and the words of consecration), yet
there are minor details in which we are not
required to do so. For example, our cele-
brations cannot follow the Jewish Passover,
or be held in an upper room at Jerusalem
with none but the clergy present. And the
hour at which we celebrate need not be the
same.

The Jewish Passover was celebrated in the
evening, for it was *during the night* that the
destroying angel passed over the houses of the
Israelites, thus sparing them from death. Our
