# The Holy Bible. 337

straint, on the part of his earthly instruments,
as if He had had no share in the work. As
God rules the will, yet the will is free,—as He
rules the course of the world, yet men conduct
it,—so He has inspired the Bible, yet men have
written it. Whatever else is true about it, this
is true,—that we may speak of the history, or
mode of its composition, as truly as of that of
other books; we may speak of its writers having
an object in view, being influenced by circum-
stances, being anxious, taking pains, purposely
omitting or introducing things, leaving things
incomplete, or supplying what others had so
left. Though the Bible be inspired, it has all
such characteristics as might attach to a book
uninspired,—the characteristics of dialect and
style, the distinct effects of times and places,
youth and age, of moral and intellectual character;
and I insist on this, lest I seem to forget (what
I do not forget), that in spite of its human form,
it has in it the spirit and the mind of God." [^1]

"At first sight, and judged by an ordinary
literary estimate, the Bible presents an ap-
pearance of being merely a large collection of
heterogeneous writings. Historical records,
ranging over many centuries, biographies, dia-
logues, anecdotes, catalogues of moral maxims,
and accounts of social experiences, poetry,
the most touchingly plaintive and the most
buoyantly triumphant, predictions, exhortations,
warnings, varying in style, in authorship, in
date, in dialect, are thrown, as it seems, some-
what arbitrarily into a single volume. . . . But
beneath the differences of style, of language,
and of method, which are undeniably prominent
