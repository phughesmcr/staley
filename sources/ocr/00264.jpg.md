# The Commandments. 247

in the Appendix at page 403. Whilst there is
considerable early authority for keeping certain
of the fasting days more rigorously than others,
there is no English authority for making a
distinction between *fasting* and *abstinence*. In
the writings of our divines, the words 'fasting'
and 'abstinence' are used interchangeably, no
hint being given of any such distinction as that
which now obtains in the Roman Church.

Fasting before Communion is, as we shall see
later on, the custom of the whole Church. (See
pages 280, etc.)

### iii. ALMSGIVING.

Almsgiving is the giving of money, goods, or
time to the special service of God. The
principle upon which almsgiving rests is con-
tained in the words of David, "All things
come of thee, and of thine own have we given
thee."[^1] The practice of giving alms is a recog-
nition of the sovereignty of God. By making
a definite return of our substance to him, we
acknowledge that all we have is his.

It was the rule of the Jews to give one tenth
of the year's produce to the service of God.
Christians are bound to give alms in a
systematic manner, according as God has
blessed them. Almsgiving is a great safeguard
against "the love of money (which) is a root
of all kinds of evil."[^2]

more solemn and penitential office of the Litany. And in
the table of the fasts to be observed, all Fridays in the year,
except Christmas-day, are expressly mentioned."â€”Bishop
Bull's *Vindication of the Church of England*, xxvi.
