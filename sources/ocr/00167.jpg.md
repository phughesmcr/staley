# 148 The Faith of the Church.

question arises,—Whence came all this: Who
made it? There is but one answer,—What-
ever secondary causes there may be in creation,
yet behind all is the First Cause,—The Cause
of causes,—God. The question, Which was
first, the hen or the egg? admits of but one
reply;—Whichever was first, God made it.
"In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth."[^1] On a Bedouin being asked, How
do you know there is a God? he replied, In
the same way that I know on looking at the
sand, when a man or a beast has crossed the
desert; by his footprints in the world around
me. As St. Paul puts it,—"The invisible
things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made, even his eternal power
and Godhead."[^2]

There is in the Confessions of St. Augustine a
beautiful passage which tells us how nature
leads up to God,—"I questioned the earth, and
it said, 'I am not He;' and all that is in it con-
fessed the same. I questioned the sea and the
depths, and the creeping things which have life,
and they replied, 'We are not thy God, seek
above us.' I questioned the blowing winds, and
the whole air with its inhabitants replied . . .
'I am not God.' I questioned the heavens, sun,
moon, and stars; 'Neither are we,' say they,
'God whom you seek.' And I said to all those
things which stand about the doors of my
flesh, 'Ye have told me of my God, that ye
are not He; tell me now something of him.'
And they cried out with a loud voice, 'He
made us.'"[^3]
