# 146 The Faith of the Church.

## IV. THE ARTICLES OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH.

Of the articles of the Christian Faith we are
now about to speak in detail, taking the Apostles'
Creed as the ground-work.

### i. "I believe in God the Father almighty."

#### 1. The Existence of God.

Holy Scripture does not begin by proving
God's existence; it takes it for granted. The
existence of God is not a matter for mathe-
matical demonstration. We cannot prove his
existence with the same kind of certainty that
we can prove that two and two make four.
We do sums with our heads, but we believe in
God with our hearts. "With the heart man
believeth."[^1] But if there is no such mathe-
matical demonstration of God's existence, yet
there are abundant proofs of another kind, which
makes a moral certainty that He *is*.

We believe that the earth revolves on its axis
once in every twenty-four hours, for reasons
which admit of no other conclusion. So almost
everything points to God's existence: all nature
speaks of a creator, and preserver. Conscience
tells of him, for it points to an unseen judge.
Reason induces us to believe in him, and then
faith comes to our aid and confirms its conclu-
sions. What is wanting in actual demonstration,
faith supplies. Reason leads us on far in our
search for God, but the final step must be taken
in faith; and when that step is taken, faith is
assured, and becomes a God-given certainty.
