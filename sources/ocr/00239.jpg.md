# The Faith of the Church.

THE CHURCH IS APOSTOLIC, because she can
trace her origin to the apostles of Christ, and
is governed by their successors, and believes,
preserves, and teaches the apostles' doctrine.

It is a matter of deepest regret that not one
of the four notes of the Church is now, or ever
has been, universally realized. Her unity is
marred by grievous divisions, her whole history
shews an imperfectly attained sanctity, the
greater part of the world still lies outside her
fold, her discipline has never been fully accepted
or faithfully exercised. Yet these 'notes' form
the hope of the Church, and when she attains
to their full measure, she will be presented as
the bride to the heavenly bridegroom "a glorious
Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
such thing."[^1]

vi. "The Communion of Saints."

By the term *communion* in this article of the
Creed, we are to understand 'fellowship.' This
fellowship of saints is grounded on the truth
that all the saints, living and departed, are
united to Jesus Christ, and form his mystical
body. The saints are members one of another,
because they are members of Christ's body, the
Holy Catholic Church. "So we, being many,
are one body in Christ, and every one members
one of another."[^2]

The term *saints*, or 'holy ones,' is applied in
the New Testament to all the baptized living
upon earth, who have not forfeited baptismal
grace. The baptized are saints in the sense
