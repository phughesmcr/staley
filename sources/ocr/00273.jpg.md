# 256 The Sacraments.

we are in Adam,—not only because we sin as
he did, but because we inherit his fallen nature.
We are made alive in Christ, not only by fol-
lowing his example, but the rather by being
brought into union with his unfallen nature.
In breaking the tie which binds us to the first
Adam in his fallen state, and by being placed
in the ranks of the second Adam, in this lies
our only hope of deliverance from the evil spell
which our union with the first Adam has cast
over us. We must get out of connection with
"the first man," into connection with "the
second man, the Lord from heaven."¹ We
must destroy the old relationship, and form a
new one. We must transfer our allegiance
from Adam to Christ. We must break corres-
pondence with the one, and place ourselves in
correspondence with the other. In short, we
need to escape from a natural into a super-
natural state,—the state of grace.

How is this great change to be accomplished,
and so mighty a transfer to be wrought? The
answer is,—By means of the sacraments, which
Christ ordained for this very purpose. Sacra-
ments are "effectual signs of grace," they effect
what they signify; by them God "doth work
invisibly in us."² The sacraments lift us out
of our natural state, and place us in, and keep
us in, a supernatural state,—the state of grace.
Hence, the sacraments are commonly called
*the Means of Grace*. The sacraments place us
in living union with Jesus Christ, from whose
sacred humanity all grace flows. But to re-

extends from one person to the whole of humanity."—St.
Gregory Nyssen, *Great Catechism*, xvi.
