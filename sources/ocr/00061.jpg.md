# The Ministry of the Church. 41

instance to the apostles, to be handed on by
them to the bishops who succeeded them. In
the words,—" Go ye therefore, and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost,"[^1] Christ instituted the sacrament of
Holy Baptism.

In the words,—" Take, eat: this is my body,
which is broken for you: this do in remem-
brance of me. . . . . This cup is the new
testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye
drink it, in remembrance of me,"[^2] He ordained
the sacrament of his Body and Blood.

In the words,—" Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them,"[^3] He instituted the ordinance of
Absolution.

" There is not in the world" says Bishop
Jeremy Taylor "a greater presumption, than
that any should think to convey a gift of God,
unless by God he be appointed to do it."[^4]

To say, 'I baptize thee,' or 'This is my body,'
and 'This is my blood,' or 'I absolve thee,'
would be presumptuous, unless the person who
used these solemn words was duly authorized by
God to do so. There is, moreover, no guarantee
that such words would effect what they mean,
unless used by competent persons, that is to say
by the bishops and those sent by them.[^5]

[^5]: In cases of extreme necessity, where no minister of the
Church can be had, baptism by a layman or a woman, with
water and in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Ghost, though irregular, has been recognized as
valid.
