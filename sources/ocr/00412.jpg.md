# Sacramental Confession. 391

sins to the priest, to be offended with them that are satisfied
with their humble confession to God, and the general con-
fession to the Church. But in all things to follow and keep
the rule of charity, and every man to be satisfied with his
own conscience, not judging other men's minds or con-
sciences, whereas he hath no warrant of God's word to the
same."â€”*First Prayer Book of Edward VI.*
