# 234 The Commandments.

God or towards man, which may not be implied
from them.

The Commandments were given on two occa-
sions by God himself, and each time from a
mount. It was on Mount Sinai that He delivered
the moral law to Moses to teach to the chosen
people. It was in the Sermon on the Mount
that Jesus Christ again laid down the divine
law, giving it a fuller and wider meaning.
The chosen people received the law of God
written on two tables of stone. Christians
have received the law of love written by the
Holy Ghost in their minds and hearts (*Heb*.
viii. 10). Our Lord's explanation of the Ten
Commandments is found in the fifth, sixth,
and seventh chapters of the Gospel according
to St. Matthew.

There are two ways of regarding the Com-
mandments. They are to be regarded as
*positive* and as *negative* at the same time;
that is to say, each of the commandments
enjoins as well as forbids, teaching both what
is to be done, and what is not to be done.
'Thou shalt do this,' implies 'Thou shalt not
do that;' and 'Thou shalt not do this,' implies
'Thou shalt do that.' By this is meant that
where a virtue is commanded, the opposite
vice is condemned; and where a vice is
forbidden, the opposite virtue is enjoined. It
is to be observed that although the Com-
mandments were originally given to a nation,
yet each of them is addressed to individuals,â€”
"*Thou* shalt," or "*Thou* shalt not." By this
we are taught that the keeping of the Com-
mandments is a personal matter, in which each
individual is concerned.
