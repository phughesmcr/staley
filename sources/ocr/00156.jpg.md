# The Faith of the Church. 137

The use of creeds is earlier than the writing
of the first books of the New Testament. In
St. Paul's Epistles we find traces of the Creed
in his allusion to "the faithful saying,"[^1] "the
form of sound words,"[^2] "the deposit."[^3]

## II. THE THREE CREEDS.

The Creeds are three in number; viz.,â€”

i. The Apostles' Creed.
ii. The Nicene Creed.
iii. The Creed of St. Athanasius.

### i. THE APOSTLES' CREED.

The Apostles' Creed receives its name from
the fact that it is derived from the teaching
of the apostles. It contains the main truths
which they preached to the world, speaking
only of those things which they had seen and
heard, while they followed the Lord Jesus.

Although references to, and quotations from,
the Creeds are met with in early Christian
writers, yet a complete creed is not found in
any document until late in the second century.
The Apostles' Creed, as we have it, is the
Roman form of the Western Creeds, and is
first found in the exposition of Rufinus in the
fourth century. The late appearance of the
Creed in writing is accounted for by the fact,

[^1]: 1 Tim. i. 15; iv. 9. 2 Tim. ii. 11. Titus i. 9; iii. 8.
[^2]: 2 Tim. i. 13.
[^3]: 1 Tim. vi. 20. 2 Tim. i. 12 (*R.V. margin*).
