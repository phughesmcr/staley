# CHAPTER I.

## INTRODUCTION.

ALMIGHTY God in his love created all
things. At the head of this lower world
He placed man, giving him the power to choose,
to love and serve him freely.

That this choice might be a reality, it was
needful that man should have the power to
reject God, and to withhold his love and
service. In no other way could his will be
really free. Man, thus gifted, was put on his
trial. He failed, and so fell away from God.

But God's love was so great that, even though
rejected by man, He would not leave him to
his ruin. God pursued fallen man with a love
which is as astonishing as it is touching. The
history of the human race is the history of God's
patient love following man, in order to bring
him back to himself.

By man's evil choice his mind became dark-
ened, his heart polluted, and his will weakened.
All along the ages we find God striving to
remedy these defects, enlightening man's mind
by his truth, cleansing his heart by holy
inspirations, and aiding man's will by his
power.
