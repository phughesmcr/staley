# The Causes of the Reformation.

of learning so greatly aided by the invention of
printing in the year 1440. Of the latter, it has
been said that it was a "new gift of tongues,
which lent wings to knowledge, and put within
the reach of hundreds and presently of thousands,
precious lore which had hitherto been within
the reach of but two or three."

The first translation of the New Testament
from the original language appeared in 1525, but
a few years preceding the Reformation. Men's
eyes were opening to the errors and superstitions
of the time, and they began to question the
truth of much that they had been taught.

England was fully ripe for a great religious
revolution. Popular preachers, Wycliffe being
the chief, had been stirring the people against
the many abuses of the times. The air was full
of inflammable materials, which only awaited
some cause sufficiently exciting to set them
alight. At last came the spark that set fire
to the train so long prepared for the explosion:
—in Germany, the sale of Indulgences to which
we have referred, by the Dominican friar, Tetzel,
—in England, the unrighteous resolve of Henry
VIII. to divorce his queen.[^1]

[^1]: Whilst the sale of indulgences was mainly *the cause* of
the Reformation on the Continent, the same cannot be said
of the King's divorce; it was rather *the occasion* than *the
cause* of the Reformation in England. Roman Catholic
controversialists strive to shew that the English Reformation
stands or falls with the character of Henry viii. and his
advisers; but there can be no doubt that a crisis would have
been reached in some other way, even if Henry viii. had
never existed. The Reformation, when it came, was only
the final act of a long struggle.
