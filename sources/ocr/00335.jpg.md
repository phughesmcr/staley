# 316 Prayer.

"FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, THE POWER,  
AND THE GLORY, FOR EVER AND EVER. AMEN."

These words form what is known as the  
doxology. They are sometimes omitted from  
the Lord's Prayer in the Prayer Book. Some  
doubt has been expressed as to whether they  
form part of the Prayer as given by our Lord.  
They are found in the Prayer as printed in St.  
Matthew's Gospel, but they are wanting in that  
given in St. Luke's Gospel. But as the Lord's  
Prayer was given by Christ on two occasions,  
He may possibly have omitted the doxology in  
the one case, and added it in the other.
