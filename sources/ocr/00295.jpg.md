# 278 The Sacraments.

the meat which endureth unto everlasting life."
Jesus Christ declares that it is his special
province to give it, and that the Father has
"sealed," or appointed him to do so (verse 27).
He goes on to identify this bread of life with
himself, saying, "I am the bread of life" (verse
35). He next teaches explicitly that the bread
of life is his flesh, in the words, "the bread that
I will give is my flesh" (verse 51), and declares
in the plainest terms that the life of the soul
depends on feeding upon him,—"Verily, verily,
I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the
Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no
life in you" (verse 53). This language about
eating the flesh and drinking the blood of Christ
is never again used in the New Testament
except in reference to the Holy Communion.
Our Lord concludes this great discourse by con-
necting the highest blessings with this feeding
upon himself in Holy Communion,—"Whoso
eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last
day. . . . He that eateth this bread shall live
for ever" (verses 54, 58).[^1]

[^1]: The fathers have ever applied our Lord's words in St. John vi. to the Holy Communion; and this is the teaching of the Church of England as expressed in the 3rd Exhortation, and in the Prayer of Humble Access, in the Communion Service.
