# Anglican Orders.

them. . . . All bishops are the successors of
the apostles, and, as a 'co-equal power,' to use
St. Cyprian's language, was given to all the
apostles alike, so to all bishops alike are full
powers given. Such powers were involved in
our Lord's commission, and cannot be separated
from it; so necessarily they pass, whole and
undivided, to their successors, the Catholic epis-
copate. . . . It is surely ridiculous to say, that
English bishops, who trace down from the first
settlement of Christianity in England, still pos-
sessing the original sees, though under new
arrangements, cannot give to English priests
their place of work!"[^1]

The idea that all jurisdiction proceeds from
the pope was unheard of until the twelfth
century.[^2]

We will close this chapter by quoting the
weighty words spoken by one of the greatest
Catholic theologians and historians of the last
century. At the Reunion Conference held at
Bonn in 1874, Dr. Döllinger, speaking of
Anglican Orders, said,—"The solution of the
question depends solely on an examination of
historical evidence, and I must give it as the
result of my investigations, that I have no
manner of doubt as to the validity of the
episcopal succession in the English Church."[^3]

jurisdiction from the pope ought to be banished from
Christian Schools, as unheard of for twelve centuries."—
