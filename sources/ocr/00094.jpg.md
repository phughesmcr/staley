# 74 The Conversion of England.

The division continued until the close of the
thirteenth century, when the British Church
was finally absorbed in the province of Canter-
bury.[^1]

Whilst rightly grateful to Rome for thus
taking the lead in the conversion of England,
we must not forget that there are other sources
of our English Christianity, possessing a more
extensive influence. The Roman mission was
successful as regards the kingdom of Kent,
enlarging its influence as far as London, and
partly into Essex, but it advanced no further.

English. There is, we may say it with thankfulness, a real
continuity between the British and the English Church ; but
it consists in this, that by slow degrees—first by the Britons'
acceptance of the Roman Easter, then by the establishment
of precedents in favour of the consecration of Welsh bishops
at Canterbury, then by the assertion of jurisdiction by
Canterbury over Wales, and lastly by the exercise of
visitatorial power by Canterbury in Wales—by a complex
process which extended through some five centuries, the
English Church absorbed the British into its one body ;
the older and smaller stream flowed into the younger and
larger, and became a veritable and inseparable part of it."
