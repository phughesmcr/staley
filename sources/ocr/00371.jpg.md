# 352 Worship.

is usual to take advantage of the assembling of
the people to impart to them instruction and
exhortation; but worship, strictly speaking, is
distinct from such exercises.

That the English Church takes a right view
of the relative importance of worship and
preaching, is evident from the fact that while
she provides four public services, — Mattins,
Litany, the Holy Eucharist, and Evensong,—
the Sermon is only ordered at one of the four,
namely at the Holy Eucharist.

THE CHURCH'S CHIEF ACT OF WORSHIP IS
THE CELEBRATION OF THE HOLY EUCHARIST.
THIS IS THE ONE SERVICE APPOINTED BY OUR
LORD JESUS CHRIST. A GREAT FESTIVAL, OR
LORD'S DAY PASSED WITHOUT TAKING PART
IN THIS SUPREME ACT OF CHRISTIAN WORSHIP
IS NOT SPENT ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE
INTENTION.

Mattins and Evensong, services appointed by
the Church, are adjuncts to the Eucharistic
Service, not substitutes for it. The use of the
collect from the Eucharistic Service at Mattins
and Evensong, connects the latter services with
the former. Moreover, the richness and beauty
of the Psalms, Canticles, and Prayers, used at
Mattins and Evensong, can only be fully
realized, by regarding these services in their
true relation to the One Service of divine
appointment. It is therefore evident that
attendance at Mattins and Evensong cannot
be accounted as a lawful substitute for par-
ticipation in the Eucharistic Service.
