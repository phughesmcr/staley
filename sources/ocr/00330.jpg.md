# Prayer. 311

the world is to scoff at all sanctifying, and
to treat all things as common. It is the duty
of the children of God, who pray the Lord's
Prayer, to redeem common things, and to
restore their relation to him.

ii. "THY KINGDOM COME."

In this petition we chiefly pray that God's
rule may be everywhere accepted. That this
happy result may be effected, we are first of all
to be careful that the kingdom of God may
come to our own souls. Of the true servants
of God, Jesus Christ has said,—"the kingdom
of God is within you."[^1] St. Paul writes,—
"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal
body."[^2] Within the soul of every man is a
throne, upon which either God or sin sits as
a king. We pray that God alone may occupy
the throne of the heart. When this is so, we
shall be able to influence others for good, and
so God's kingdom will spread in the world.

He who prays this petition should take a real
interest in the Church's missions to the heathen.
If we cannot give alms, we can offer our prayers
that God will bless and prosper the missionary
work of his Church.

In this petition we pray for Christ's second
coming to judgment, when all remaining
enemies shall be put under his feet. Unless
the kingdom has come to our hearts, we are
not ready for Christ's coming at the end of the
world. As we cannot alter the Prayer, we
must alter our lives, and thus be getting ready
for the second coming of our Lord.
