generally disobeyed. This disorder has con-
tinued in many particulars even to our own
times. Slowly, yet increasingly, the Church is
recovering her lost heritage in the matter of
ceremonial.[^1]

Persons are often perplexed, and naturally so,
at the diversities of ceremonial prevailing in our
midst. At some churches they find the Holy
Eucharist celebrated by a priest in vestments,
with lights on the altar, and other accessories.
At other churches they find an absence of such
usages. The reason for this state of things is,
that in the one case the clergy are obeying the
directions of the Ornaments Rubric, whilst in
the other case past disuse or prevailing custom
is pleaded for disregarding these directions.

## ii.

The rubric orders THE RETAINING and THE
USE of "such Ornaments of the Church, and of
the Ministers thereof at all times of their Minis-
tration, as were in this Church of England by
the authority of Parliament, in the second year
of the reign of King Edward VI.

There are several sources from which we
may learn what 'ornaments' are here alluded

[^1]: The following statistics, taken from the Tourist's Church Guide for 1901, show a remarkable increase in important matters of ceremonial during a period of ten years.
