# 394 Kalendar of the English Church.

3. By the absence of the names of Irish and Scottish saints. This is a defect which we inherit, except as regards St. Bridget, from the Sarum Kalendar. It is a defect which we may hope some day to see supplied, at least as far as regards the more famous saints of the two sister countries and Churches of Scotland and Ireland.

4. By the absence of the names of Eastern saints such as the following, all of whom are commemorated in the present Roman Kalendar, viz., Saints Athanasius, Basil the Great, Chrysostom, Gregory Nazianzen, Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp. Many more great names might be added from Eastern sources. All except St. Basil were absent from the Sarum Kalendar; hence our loss. The two Greek fathers, St. Athanasius and St. Chrysostom, are recognized in the Prayer Book, though not in the Kalendar.
