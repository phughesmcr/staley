(2) The Prophets. The authors of this part of
the Old Testament are sixteen in number, four
being known as 'the greater prophets,' and
twelve as 'the lesser prophets.' The four greater
prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and
Daniel; and hence we find their writings placed
before those of the lesser prophets, being greater
both in length and in importance. The prophets
were men sent by God, who spoke for him in
teaching, warning, and encouraging his people,
and in foretelling future events, specially those
concerning the coming of Jesus Christ. Thus,
for example, long years before He came, Isaiah
foretold his Virgin-birth;[^1] Micah prophesied
that He should be born in Bethlehem;[^2] and
Zechariah, that He should be betrayed for thirty
pieces of silver, and be crucified;[^3] whilst Daniel
foretold his second coming in glory.[^4]

(3) The Psalms. The third division of the
Old Testament consists of the Poetical Books,
and is named the Psalms, or the Psalter, from
the first of these books. The other poetical
books, Job, the Lamentations of Jeremiah, the
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon,
radiate round the Psalter as planets round the
sun.

The Canonical Books of the Old Testament
were collected into one whole by the Jewish
Church many years before the birth of Christ.
When He came, it was not to destroy the Law
or the Prophets, but to fulfil them.[^5] Our Lord
often quoted from the Old Testament, referring
to that volume as "the Scriptures." Speaking
