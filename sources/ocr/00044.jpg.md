# The Ministry of the Church.

It became a rule of the Church in very early
days, that at least three successors of the apostles
(or bishops as they were called), should lay their
hands upon the heads of those whom they ad-
mitted to the highest office of the ministry.

The figure of a chain, reaching link by link
from the apostles' days down to our own times,
has been used in describing the apostolic suc-
cession. But the figure of a net is more true
to fact. The connection between the chief
ministers of the Church and the apostles, is
not so much of the nature of a chain, as of
a vast network. If by chance one strand of
the net should fail, yet the whole would not
be broken up. "It has been mathematically
argued that, even if we make the absurd sup-
position of one consecrator in twenty at any
particular moment in history having been,
through some accident, himself not validly
consecrated, the chances will be 8,000 to 1
against all three consecrators in any given case
being in like position." [^1]

The reason for this extraordinary care is to
guard against the loss of the Apostolic succes-
sion,â€”a loss which would result in the dying
out of the Church as our Lord constituted it.
A Church stands or falls by the apostolic suc-
cession. We shall see in the next section that
the apostolic succession is the pledge of a valid
ministry, and of valid sacraments. The term
*valid* implies the fulfilment of God's conditions
whereby certainty is secured. That which is
valid rests upon the security of the divine cove-
nant. Without a ministry possessing Christ's
