faith and repentance. If faith is the opening
and stretching forth of the hand of the soul
to receive God's gift of Justification, repentance
is the cleansing of that hand.

When we say that we are justified by faith
and repentance, we do not mean that faith or
repentance justify of themselves; but rather
that they are the conditions upon which we
are united to Christ by Justification. Faith
apprehends and appropriates the merits of
Christ, and thus it is said that we are "justified
by faith."[^1] A holy life is the evidence of a
true repentance, and of a lively faith in Christ.
Justification does not mean that God regards
us as holy, when we are not really so. "They
that keep holiness holily shall be justified."[^2]
Christians who do not live according to their
calling, and neglect the means of grace, throw
away also the gift of Justification, and lose
their salvation.

without true repentance, hope, charity, dread, and the fear
of God, at any time and season,"â€”*Homily of Salvation*,
Part ii.
