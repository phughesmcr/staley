# The Divisions in the Church.

less grave faults in a lack of love and humility
on both sides; but in truth it must be admitted
that the bulk of the blame of the division lay
with the bishops of Rome. A study of history
leads to the conclusion that the Roman claims
lay at the root of the schism between East and
West.

Such were the causes which led to the most
lamentable disaster which has ever overtaken
the Church of God, the great division between
East and West,—a schism which has already
lasted for more than 700 years, and still remains
unhealed.

The second great rift in the Catholic body
is that which took place in the West, chiefly
between the Roman and Anglican Churches
in the sixteenth century. Of this sad division,
and the causes which led to it, we shall have
occasion to speak more fully in the second part
of this work.

ii.

The divisions between East and West, and
between Rome and England, may be described
in St. Paul's language as "schism *in* the body,"
rather than schism *from* it. No one of these
three portions of the Catholic body lost any of
the essentials of Church unity;—the possession
of the apostolic succession, the divinely-appointed
sacraments, the creeds, and the moral law.[^1]

[^1]: "The communion of Christians one with another, and
the unity of them altogether, lie, not in a mutual under-
standing, intercourse, and combination, not in what they
do in common, but in what they are and have in common,
in their possession of the succession, their episcopal form,
their apostolical faith, and the use of the sacraments.
Mutual intercourse is but an accident of the Church, not
its essence."—Newman, *Tract* 90, § 12.
