# The Sacraments. 263

"the washing of regeneration,"¹ i.e., the laver
or bath of the new birth.

It is the rule of the Church that persons, on
receiving baptism publicly, should make certain
solemn promises or vows. The baptismal vows
are,—

1. To renounce the devil and all his works;
2. To believe in God; and,
3. To serve Him.

The observance of these vows forms man's
part in the baptismal covenant or agreement.

In the case of infants, these promises are
made in their name by sponsors, or god-parents.
God-parents simply promise that the child shall
fulfil its part in the baptismal covenant.

Should a baptized person depart from God
by unbelief, or by a course of grievous sin, such
an one needs conversion. He cannot be rebap-
tized, for the soul can only be once "born of
water and of the Spirit."

(See pages 322, etc.)

## II. The Holy Eucharist.

### i. The Institution.

As we have already pointed out, the sacra-
ments of Baptism and the Eucharist² possess
a special dignity. Many writers in East and
West have seen, in the water and the blood
which flowed from our Saviour's pierced side,
a symbol of these two Greater Sacraments.

¹ Titus iii. 5.

² The word, *Eucharist*, pronounced *u-ka-rist*, means
'thanksgiving,' and is the name given from the earliest
times to the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ.
