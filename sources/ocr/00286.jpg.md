# The Sacraments. 269

We have now examined the only three
passages in the Bible in which the Greek word
for 'remembrance,' is found, apart from the
accounts of the institution of the Holy Eucharist.
In each case it is used of A REMEMBRANCE BEFORE
GOD, AND NOT BEFORE MAN; and it is only
reasonable therefore to suppose, that in those
instances in which it is used of the Holy
Eucharist, it is intended to express the same
meaning which it has elsewhere in Holy Scrip-
ture, viz., that of A MEMORIAL BEFORE GOD.
That this is the true idea, is supported by St.
Paul's words spoken of the Holy Eucharist,—
"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink
this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He
come."[^1]

All that our Lord Jesus Christ did when He
instituted the blessed Sacrament was sacrificial;
it was all done in sacrificial terms, at a sacri-
ficial time, and for a sacrificial end.[^2]

In connection with this important subject,
the reader is asked to refer to what was said on
pages 206, 207, concerning the relation which
exists between the Eucharistic Sacrifice, and
our Lord's pleading in heaven.

The Church of England, in the thirty-first
Article, condemns certain false ideas concerning
the Eucharistic Sacrifice. This condemnation
needs careful explanation, for it has formed the

[^1]: 1 Cor. xi. 26.

[^2]: "'Do this in remembrance of me;' or 'for the com-
memoration of me,' and of my sacrifice offered on the cross,
and for the continual representation of it before God on
earth, as it is perpetually pleaded before him by our great
high priest in heaven."—Bishop Wordsworth on Lev. ii.
