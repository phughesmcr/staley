man. This conference marks man's special
dignity, for there is no record of such an action
on the part of God in calling the lower creatures
into being.

Man was made in the image and likeness of
God. We may understand this image of God
to be in the threefold structure of the soul,â€”the
memory, the understanding, and the will. The
image of God, which includes these three great
powers of the soul, is the natural preparation
for his likeness which is supernatural, or above
nature. This image can never be effaced how-
ever marred; it remained stamped upon the
soul after the fall. We are all born in the image
of God. The likeness of God is man's corres-
pondence with his will, and depends upon the
right use of the gifts of grace. A soul in grace
bears the likeness of God; the higher the state
of grace, the closer the likeness. The likeness
was well nigh, if not altogether, lost at the fall.

In creating man, God formed a being capable
of knowing, serving, and loving him. To do
these things is the end of man. That this
purpose might be intelligently fulfilled, He gave
man, like the angels, moral freedom.

## 5. The Fall of Man.

Man was put on his trial in the garden of
Eden. To test him, God forbade his eating of
the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil. The devil came and tempted man to dis-
obey. He yielded, and so fell away from God.[^1]
The act implies much more than at first sight
appears, for it was the deliberate sin of a being
