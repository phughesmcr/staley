# The Holy Bible. 341

of the Old Testament, He bade his followers
"Search the Scriptures, . . . they are they
which testify of me,"¹ and He added, "the
Scripture cannot be broken."² "For Christians
it will be enough to know that our Lord Jesus
Christ set the seal of His infallible sanction on
the whole of the Old Testament. He found the
Hebrew Canon as we have it in our hands
to-day, and He treated it as an authority which
was above discussion."³

ii. THE ECCLESIASTICAL BOOKS. About the
year B.C. 300, the Hebrew Old Testament was
translated into Greek at Alexandria. The trans-
lation appears to have been made for the benefit
of those foreign-born Jews and others, who were
ignorant of the Hebrew language, and who
would speak Greek as their native tongue.
This translation is called 'the Septuagint,' a
word of Latin origin meaning 'seventy.' It
received this name from a tradition that it was
made by seventy scholars in the Isle of Pharos,
off Alexandria. It is from this Greek version
that the writers of the New Testament generally
quote; and thus is explained the variations
which exist between similar passages of the Old
and New Testaments in our Authorized Version,
—our English Old Testament being a trans-
lation of the Hebrew, and our New Testament
of the Greek.

In this Greek version of the Old Testament
are found certain writings, coming after the
Prophets, which are termed the Ecclesiastical
Books, or the Apocrypha. These books contain

¹ St. John v. 39.
² Ibid. x. 35.
