# 336 The Holy Bible.

the Holy Ghost."¹ The Holy Spirit inspired
the writers of the Bible, filling their minds with
the truths which He willed to be made known,
and impelling them to write them down. In
this way the Bible is not only true as a History
of England might be true, but it contains much
that would never have been known unless God
had revealed it, and caused it to be committed
to writing. The Holy Spirit also inspired the
writers of the Bible in another direction. All

events of history, as possessed an abiding value
and a lasting interest to mankind. In speaking

a certain and sure guide in all the principles
of religion and morals.

It is true that in the composition of the Bible
the mind of man worked, but it worked under
the special guidance of God. The Bible was
produced by man acting under the influence of
God the Holy Spirit. "In what way inspira-

on the part of its instruments, which the com-
position of the Bible evidences, we know not;
but if anything is certain, it is this,—that,
though the Bible is inspired, and therefore
in one sense, written by God, yet very large
portions of it, if not far the greater part of it,
are written in as free and unconstrained a
manner, and (apparently) with as little con-
sciousness of a supernatural dictation or re-
