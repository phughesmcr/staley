# The Conversion of England. 73

was their king?' 'Aella.' 'Alleluia, praise
to God the Maker ought to be sung in those
parts.' He passed on, and saw the boys no
more."ยน

Soon after, when Gregory became bishop
of Rome, he sent out a band of some forty
monks with a priest named Augustine at their
head, as missionaries to convert the Saxons.
This was in the year 597. They landed in
Kent; and Ethelbert the king of that part of
England, whose wife, a daughter of the king
of Paris, was already a Christian, gave them
permission to settle in the Isle of Thanet.
From thence they removed to Canterbury,
which now became the head-quarters of the
Roman missionaries. The king was baptized,
and, as was usually the case, the tribe followed
his lead. In this way, a considerable part of
the south-east of the island, then known as
the kingdom of Kent, was converted to Christianity.

Augustine was anxious that the British
Christians, who had taken refuge in Wales
and Cornwall, should place themselves under
his authority. Two meetings were arranged
between them and Augustine, the first at a
place named Augustine's Oak, thought to be
situated south of the river Severn, the second
at Bangor situated in Wales. At the latter
of these meetings seven British bishops were
present. Augustine asked them to join with
him in preaching to the Saxons, and to give
up certain customs in which they differed from
the Roman uses. They refused both requests,
and also to accept him as their archbishop.
