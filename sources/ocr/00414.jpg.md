# CHAPTER IV.

## I. THE KALENDAR OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH.

IN the compilation of the Kalendar of the
English Church, the same course was
adopted as had been taken in respect to the
Prayer Book itself, the compilers consulting
the Sarum Breviary and Missal, and selecting
from the Kalendars of these books such commemorations as they thought fit.

The Anglican Kalendar is marked—

1. By the absence of all Old Testament saints
who were commemorated so numerously in the
older Western Kalendars, as they are still in
the Kalendar of the Eastern Church. The
present Roman Kalendar contains only one
such commemoration, viz.: the Maccabean
Martyrs on August 1.

2. By the absence of several New Testament
saints, including St. Joseph of Nazareth and
St. Joseph of Arimathæa. But both of these
names were absent from the majority of the
older English Church Kalendars, including the
Sarum Kalendar, and the latter may perhaps
be considered to be sufficiently commemorated
in the services of Easter Eve.
