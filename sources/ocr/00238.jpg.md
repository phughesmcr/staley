# The Faith of the Church. 219

THE CHURCH IS HOLY. The source of the
Church's holiness is the indwelling presence of
the Holy Ghost, who sanctifies her members by
uniting them to Christ the head. The Church
offers to her members grace and truth as the
means of sanctification, and is the home where
saints are nurtured and formed.

THE CHURCH IS CATHOLIC, "because it is
throughout the world, from one end of the earth
to the other; and because it teaches universally
and completely one and all the doctrines which
ought to come to men's knowledge, concerning
things both visible and invisible, heavenly and
earthly: and because it subjugates in order to
godliness every class of men, governors and
governed, learned and unlearned; and because
it universally treats and heals every sort of sins,
which are committed by soul and body, and
possesses in itself every form of virtue which
is named, both in deeds and words, and in every
kind of spiritual gifts." [^1]

The word *catholic* means 'universal,' whilst
the word *protestant* means 'making a protest.'
'Protestant' is a negative term, and does not
express positive belief of any kind. It is a
mistake for a churchman to describe himself
as 'a protestant,' for the term is nowhere to
be found either in the Bible or in the Prayer
Book, and ought not to be adopted as a designation of the Church or her members.[^2]

[^1]: St. Cyril, *Cat. Lect.* xviii. 23.

[^2]: It is true that the term 'protestant' occurs in the oath
in the Coronation Service; but this oath is imposed on the
sole authority of Parliament, not of the Church; and the
term, as there used, is simply a popular expression excluding all Roman authority, and nothing more.
