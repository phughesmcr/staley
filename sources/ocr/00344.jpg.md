## IV. Conversion.

There are two words used in the New Testa-
ment, which describe the process whereby a
man passes from a state of habitual sin to a
state of holiness. These words are Repentance
and Conversion. The first of these is most
frequently used in the New Testament, but it
is of the latter that we are now about to speak.

this great change we call Conversion. Conver-

heart, mind, and will to God. It is the willing
acceptance of the mercy, truth, and love of God.
Conversion may take place *before* baptism, lead-

of his position as the child of God by adoption
and grace.

Conversion may be sudden, or it may be
gradual. Sudden Conversion is the instan-
