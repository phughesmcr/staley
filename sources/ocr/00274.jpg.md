# The Sacraments. 257

ceive the sacraments savingly, the soul must
approach them with faith and repentance; for
they who receive unworthily, place a bar to the
flow and to the reception of grace.

iii.

In the early days of the Church, the term
*sacrament* was used in a wider sense than that
which we now attach to it. For example, St.
Augustine defines a sacrament to be "a sacred
sign," and speaks of "the sacrament of the
Creed, which they ought to believe; the sacra-
ment of the Lord's Prayer, how they ought to
ask." Any holy thing of which it could be
said, This possesses a hidden power or meaning,
was termed a sacrament. But in later times,
and by degrees, the term *sacrament* came to be
restricted to seven ordinances. Some of these
owe their existence to our Lord's direct insti-
tution, as recorded in the Gospels; others to
the apostles acting, we may believe, under
unrecorded commands of Christ (see Acts i. 3).

The Two Greater Sacraments are named:—

I. HOLY BAPTISM.
II. THE HOLY EUCHARIST.

The Five Lesser Sacraments are named:—

i. CONFIRMATION.
ii. PENANCE.
iii. HOLY ORDER.
iv. HOLY MATRIMONY.
v. UNCTION.
