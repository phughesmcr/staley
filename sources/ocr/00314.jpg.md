# The Sacraments. 295

their faults and reveal their doubts to the priest,
especially in these three cases:—first, when we
are disquieted with the guilt of some sin already
committed; or, secondly, when we cannot con-
quer some lust or passion; or, thirdly, when
we are afflicted with any intricate scruples;
particularly whether we may now be fit to
receive the blessed Sacrament or no."¹

It is upon such private confession before a
priest, that the penitent can receive the most
direct assurance of pardon which Jesus Christ
empowers the Church to pronounce. The form
of confession commonly used in this case is
as follows:—

I CONFESS to GOD the Father Almighty,
to his only begotten Son Jesus Christ,
and to God the Holy Ghost, before the whole
company of heaven, and to you, my father, that
I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word,
and deed, by my fault, my own fault, my own
most grievous fault; especially I confess that
I have committed these sins, (*after naming all
his sins, the penitent concludes the confession with
the words,*—) For these and all my other sins
which I cannot now remember, I am heartily
sorry, I firmly purpose amendment; I most
humbly ask pardon of God; and of you, my
spiritual father, I beg for penance, advice, and
absolution. Wherefore I pray God the Father
Almighty, his only begotten Son Jesus Christ,
and God the Holy Ghost to have mercy upon
me, and you, my father, to pray for me to the
Lord our God. Amen.
