The term Justification describes the state

i.e., the state in which God's favour rests upon
the soul, and his help assists it.

of his Spirit."[^4] This action of the Holy Spirit
is *the efficacious cause* of our Justification, en-

Sacraments are *the instrumental cause* of Justi-
fication on God's part; they are the divinely-
appointed instruments by which God "doth
work invisibly in us."[^5] In order that the soul
may receive sacramental grace savingly, it is
