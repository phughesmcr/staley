# 296 The Sacraments.

The Church of England invites sinners, who
cannot otherwise make their peace with God,
to open their grief (i.e., to reveal the sin which
causes the grief) before the priest, in order that
they may secure "the benefit of absolution."
Such confession is called by Bishop Cosin,
*Sacramental Confession*, and is a blessed privilege
open to all who heartily desire it. Our blessed
Lord has given to his priests power and au-
thority to absolve from all sins, and He surely
means them to use this power. But before
they can fully do so, it is needful that those
seeking absolution should confess their sins.
Thus we may be quite sure that private con-
fession, as an outcome of real contrition, is a
practice well pleasing to our Lord.[^1]

We must remember that, strictly speaking,
to absolve is not to forgive; God alone forgives.
To absolve is to unloose the bonds which sin
has placed upon the soul, and to remove the bar
to the receiving of grace. In raising Lazarus
from the dead, our Lord pronounced the words,
"Loose him, and let him go."[^2] This was the
part of the people towards him whom Christ
raised. And so God, who pardons the penitent,
bids the priest in absolution to loose him and
let him go.

The Church of England, in Canon CXIII.,
strictly forbids the priest to divulge what has
been said in confession. The words are,â€”"If
any man confess his secret and hidden sins to
the minister . . . we do straitly charge and
admonish him, that he do not at any time reveal
