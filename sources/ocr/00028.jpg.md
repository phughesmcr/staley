# Introduction.

The moral law in the ten commandments
is perfected, and raised to a higher meaning by
Christ in the Sermon on the Mount, and made
binding upon Christian people.

The priesthood is summed up and perfected
in Christ, the great high priest, and continued
in the Christian ministry; the hereditary de-
scent of the sons of Aaron finding its counterpart
in the spiritual descent of the apostolic suc-
cession.

The royal priesthood of the Jewish nation
finds its expression in the lay priesthood of
the Christian Church.

The sacrament of Holy Baptism takes the
place of the rite of Circumcision, and the Holy
Eucharist of the Jewish Passover.

The fasts and festivals of the Jewish Church
make way for those of the Christian Church,
whilst the Jewish Sabbath passes into the
Christian Sunday.

In short, the old Church was absorbed in
the new; and the Jewish religion, filled with
new meaning and endowed with new powers,
through the coming of God in the flesh,
and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
at Pentecost, passed into THE CATHOLIC[^1]
RELIGION.

[^1]: For an explanation of the term Catholic, the reader is referred to page 219.

"The religion of which Jesus is the author, and which
the Spirit of Jesus founded on the day of Pentecost, was no
mere novelty; not a system which arose aside from, and did
not fall in with, the main line of the dispensations of God.
