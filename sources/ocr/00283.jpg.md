# 266 The Sacraments.

He added,—" Drink ye all of it; for this is my
blood of the new testament, which is shed for
many for the remission of sins."¹

St. Paul, who was not called to be an apostle
until after our Lord's ascension, was not present
on the solemn occasion of which we are speak-
ing; but our blessed Lord vouchsafed to him
later a special revelation concerning the insti-
tution, which he records in these words,—" For
I have received of the Lord that which also I
delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the
same night in which He was betrayed, took
bread; and when He had given thanks, He
brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my body,
which is broken for you: this do in remem-
brance of me. After the same manner also He
took the cup, when He had supped, saying,
This cup is the new testament in my blood: this
do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this
cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till He come.
Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or
drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."²

Thus, Jesus our Lord instituted the Holy
Sacrament of his body and blood, commanding
his apostles and their successors to consecrate
bread and wine, as He had done, to be his flesh
and blood, and to make a perpetual memorial of
his death before the Father.
