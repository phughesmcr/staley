# The Causes of the Reformation. 95

It was a time when the Roman see, if it were
to preserve the unity of the Church, should have
put itself at the head of the reforming movement.
It did nothing of the kind, but resisted all pressure
for the assembling of a Council, until it was too
late. The Council of Trent summoned at
length by the pope, did not meet, or put forth
any decision, until the Reformation in its
earliest and strongest movement was over.
The decrees of this Council were not published
until 1564, in Queen Elizabeth's reign.

There were no doubt very grievous circum-
stances connected with the English Reformation,
chiefly the arbitrary, cruel, and licentious deal-
ings of Henry VIII., and the greed of Henry
and his nobles in despoiling the religious houses
for the sake of their lands and abounding wealth,
on which they laid their hands. It has been
well said that 'the prize they fought for was *the
goods*, and not *the good* of the Church.' But no
unprejudiced mind can doubt that there were
grievous superstitions that needed removal,
doctrines which had to be reconciled with the
word of God, and Church order which had to
be restored both in the episcopal and parochial
systems, and freedom to be asserted both in
civil and ecclesiastical matters. The authority
of the bishops had been lowered by the extra-
vagant claims of the Roman see, the bishops
being regarded as so many curates of the pope.
The great part of our contention is the truth
that the authority of our bishops is derived
directly from Christ himself, and is independent
of the papacy.

The appeal made by our divines during the
Reformation period, was to a General Council
