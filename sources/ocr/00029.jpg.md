# Introduction. 9

The religion of Jesus is the flower, of which the Jewish
Church is the bud, and the Patriarchal the stem ; it is a
true development and outgrowth of earlier principles.
Christianity appears as the descendant of a most ancient
religion, not merely as its successor, but as the interpreter
of its rites, and the key to its prophecies."â€”Hutchings, *The
Person and Work of the Holy Ghost*, 4th Ed., p. 108.
