Almighty God would, with her consent, take
human form in her womb. "Hail, thou that
art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee:
blessed art thou among women. . . . Fear
not, Mary: for thou has found favour with
God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
womb, and bring forth a Son, and shalt call
his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall
be called the Son of the Highest."[^1]

Then arose in Mary's mind the wondering
question, how could she, a virgin, bear a
child? Had ever maiden become mother
without the agency of human father? "Then
said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be,
seeing I know not a man?"[^2] There is
no doubting in her question; Mary believes
that it will be as the angel said, and only en-
quires how it will be accomplished.

It was then that Gabriel announced to Mary
that the agency of a human father would be
superseded, and that, through the power of God,
a virgin-birth would be accomplished. He
assured her that in conceiving and bringing
forth her Child, her virgin-chastity would
remain, that she would still be a virgin.[^3] He
declared that she should fulfil the mother's
part, God the Holy Ghost quickening the
powers of nature. "And the angel answered
and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
overshadow thee: therefore also that holy
thing which shall be born of thee shall be
called the Son of God."[^4]
