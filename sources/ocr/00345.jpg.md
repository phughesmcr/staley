# 326 The Christian Course.

taneous passage "from darkness to light," without
any intervening twilight,—a violent change in
the soul's history. Such conversions are rare,
and we may regard them as the exception
rather than the rule. The case of the penitent
thief, the jailer at Philippi, and that of St.
Paul, fall under the head of sudden Conversion.
Lacordaire, the great French preacher, in de-
scribing his own Conversion, said,—"I seem
to see a man who is making his way along, as
it were, by chance, and with a bandage over
his eyes; it is a little loosened—he catches a
glimpse of the light—and, at the moment when
the handkerchief falls, he stands face to face
with the noon-day sun. . . . This touch of
grace was in him so vivid that he never lost
the memory of it. On his death-bed he des-
cribed this *sublime moment* with just the same
emotion. . . . Every Christian knows this state,
more or less, but Conversion is not ordinarily
produced in the way of sudden illumination,
like a flash of lightning in a dark night, but
rather under the form of growing daylight, like
that which precedes the sunrise." [^1]

The majority of earnest people find it impos-
sible to say *when* they first consciously yielded
up the heart to God. The life of such has been
a succession of gentle changes and renewals,
each bringing the soul nearer to him. The
process of Conversion in these cases has been
decidedly gradual, "first the blade, then the ear,
after that the full corn in the ear." [^2]
