# Prayer. 305

Prayer implies and teaches our dependence
upon God, in whom "we live, and move, and
have our being."[^1] Prayer must be offered in
faith, and through the merits of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ. "What things soever
ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive
them, and ye shall have them."[^2] "If ye shall
ask anything in my name, I will do it."[^3]

"We all have to seek God's face above; we
all have souls to be sanctified and saved; we
all have sins and passions to beat back and to
conquer. And these things are achieved pre-
eminently by prayer, which is properly and
representatively the action of religion. It is
the action whereby we men, in all our frailty
and defilement, associate ourselves with our
divine Advocate on high, and realize the sub-
lime bond which in him, the one Mediator
between God and man, unites us in our utter
unworthiness to the strong and all-holy God."[^4]

## Objections to Prayer answered.

works by law, it is useless to pray; for how can
man's prayers alter God's laws? It is true that
where we see God's working it is according to
law and order, whether in nature or in grace.
But God's law is not a blind unreasoning force,
which works in a groove as a mere machine;
But the free action of the intelligent will of a
moral agent. Almighty God is not bound by
