# 300 The Sacraments.

When our Lord said,â€”"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery,"[^1] it has been thought that He is not referring to unfaithfulness after marriage, but to unchastity in the woman before marriage which had not been acknowledged. The Greek word here translated 'fornication,' is generally used of sin in an unmarried person, and not of unfaithfulness in a wife, for which a different word, translated 'adultery,' is constantly used. The Jewish law punished with death a bride who thus deceived her husband.

By the laws of the Church, which are based upon the Holy Scriptures, there are certain forbidden degrees of relationship within which marriages are unlawful. A list of these will be found at the end of this book. (See page 404.)

Marriage contracted before a Registrar, though valid, lacks the benediction of the Church, which every Christian couple should seek and secure. Baptized persons only are eligible for marriage by the Church.

## VII. UNCTION.

In speaking of the Reformation we said, that whilst the English Church came out of the movement with essentials unimpaired, yet there were certain losses which we need to repair. Of one of these losses, and that a serious one, we must now speak. We refer to the Sacrament of Unction, or the Anointing of the Sick.
