# The Faith of the Church. 193

cannot but heartily thank God that He has pro-
vided such an interval, in which the work of
grace begun on earth may be continued and
perfected. Speaking of the saintly John Keble,
Dr. Pusey wrote,â€”"It would be expected of
such a humble soul as that of the author of
*The Christian Year*, that the prospect of such
a preparation was an unspeakable comfort to
him within a year of his death. He expressed
it both to myself and others."[^1]

Our thoughts of the departed who in this life
sought to obey God and to keep themselves
pure and true, can only be those of unspeakable
rest in Christ.[^2] It has moreover been widely
believed in the Church, that the more exalted
of the faithful departed, though they have not
yet attained to their perfect consummation
and bliss, are even now brought into close
association with our Lord in his heavenly glory
and mediation.[^3]

For the many who depart this life apparently
neither good enough for heaven nor bad enough
for hell, we may hope that a place of mercy is
provided in the intermediate state, in which the
evil will be completely purged, and the good per-
fectly developed. It is reasonable to suppose
that when this purification is accomplished,
such souls will enter into perfect peace, and
advance towards that final and unending happi-
ness which will follow the resurrection of the
body and the last judgment.
