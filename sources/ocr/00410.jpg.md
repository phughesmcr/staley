# Sacramental Confession. 389

all sinners who truly repent and believe in him.'
This power I believe to be ministerial, as in
Baptism, since it pleases God to employ visible
instruments in conveying his mercies to the
soul.

(3.) "This power, I believe to be conferred
on priests in their ordination, in the solemn
words, 'Receive the Holy Ghost for the office
and work of a priest in the Church of God, now
committed unto thee by the imposition of our
hands. Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are
forgiven; and whose sins thou dost retain, they
are retained,' and that which is done in his
name, and according to his will, He confirms
in heaven, as He says: 'Whatsoever ye shall
bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and
whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven.' (St. Matt. xviii. 18.)

(4.) "I believe that Absolution is not only
a comfort, but is a means of grace to the soul;
or rather is a comfort, because it is a means of
grace to the soul; and that God, through man,
pronounces forgiveness of sins upon all who
truly repent and turn to him.

(5.) "I believe that, being a means of grace
with an outward visible sign, it does, according
to the teaching of our Church, in a secondary
sense, come under the title of 'sacrament,' and
that our Homilies in that secondary sense do so
call it, as having 'the promise of forgiveness of
sins' (although not exclusively), and an outward
sign, imposition of hands, although the grace
of forgiveness is not tied or restricted to that
act.
