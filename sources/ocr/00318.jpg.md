# The Sacraments. 299

## VI. HOLY MATRIMONY.

Holy Matrimony or Marriage is the Sacrament which hallows the union of man and woman, and bestows upon them the grace to live together in godliness and love. Marriage is 'an honourable estate, instituted of God in the time of man's innocency,' and is described by St. Paul as a "great mystery," and as a type of the union between Christ and his Church.[^1]

Marriage is a bond sealed by God, which nothing but death can break. In speaking of this bond, our Lord said,—"For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."[^2]

Marriage having this binding force, divorce is contrary to the divine institution. Unfortunately the State in this land, as in other countries, has placed itself at variance with the law of Christ and of his Church, both in the way in which it permits divorce, and also in sanctioning the marriage of divorced persons. It is true that a difference of opinion exists in the Church, as to the lawfulness of an innocent party re-marrying after separation from a guilty partner.[^3] But the law of the Church of England, as expressed in the Marriage Service and in Canon CVII., is that such re-marriage is contrary to the divine intention,—death alone being regarded as the dissolver of the bond, setting the survivor free to marry again.[^4]
