# The Divisions in the Church. 63

There is good reason to believe that the divisions
in the Church are of such a nature, that her
organic unity through union with Christ and
the indwelling of his Holy Spirit, has not been
broken. There is such a thing as *internal* unity,
as well as *external* unity. We believe that
external unity may be broken, whilst internal
unity remains undisturbed; or as Dr. Pusey
puts it, that "suspended inter-communion alone
does not destroy unity."

These divisions in the body are of the nature
of serious wounds, rather than of amputation
of limbs. They are as deep fissures or cracks
upon the surface of the earth, which do not
separate the earth into two or more worlds.
We may regard the divisions in the Church
under the figure of a serious quarrel amongst
brothers, by which the natural bond of a
common parentage is not broken. Brothers
may be disunited, but they remain brothers
still.

The only thing which can mortally affect the
unity of the Church, is the loss of any of the
essential links ordained by our Lord to keep
us united to himself. We may believe that
nothing was done in either of the cases we are
considering, to cut off any of the portions of
the Catholic Church from Jesus Christ.

At present the Eastern, the Roman, and the
Anglican portions of the Church, make up the
Catholic body—the Universal Church.[^1] "The
Church is to be regarded as the divinely-

language, opposed, alas! in some things to one another,
still before the throne of God they are One Holy Catholic
Apostolic Church."—Pusey, *Eirenicon* I, p. 57.
