# 272 The Sacraments.

spoke of the Holy Eucharist as "the unbloody
sacrifice." The Eucharistic Sacrifice is not so
much on a line with the sacrifice on Calvary,
as with the pleading of that sacrifice in heaven.
(2). Our Lord's sacrifice upon the cross is
a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation,
and satisfaction, for the sins of the whole world,
—not only for birth-sin, but for all actual sin.
(3). That souls in the intermediate state are
benefited by the offering of the Eucharistic Sac-
rifice, has always been believed in the Church.
St. Augustine speaks of "the Sacrifice of our
Ransom" being offered on behalf of his departed
mother. Our Lord's death upon the cross was
for all men, throughout all time, and the Euchar-
istic pleading of that death avails for all the
Church, both on earth and in the next world.
As we have already said, there is not one of the
primitive liturgies which does not contain prayers
for the departed, in union with the shewing forth
of the Lord's death in the Eucharist. In cele-
brating the Eucharist, the English Church prays
that "we and all thy whole Church may obtain
remission of our sins, and all other benefits of
Christ's Passion." The living compose but a
small part of "all the whole Church," the
greater part of the Church being in the
intermediate state.[^1]

"The sacrifice of the Mass" must be distin-
guished from "the sacrifices of Masses," of
which the Article speaks. The latter expression

[^1]: By the expression "all thy whole Church," Bishop
Cosin understood "those which are here on earth, and
those that rest in the sleep of peace, being departed in the
faith of Christ."— *W*.    119.
