# The Faith of the Church. 217

God the Father as the Creator, in God the Son
as the Redeemer, in God the Holy Ghost as
the Sanctifier. From the opening words "I
believe in God," down to the words "I believe
in the Holy Ghost," the subject of the Creed
is God. If we look on to the end of the Creed
we come to the words, "the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and the life ever-
lasting." These are matters in which man is
chiefly concerned. The forgiveness of sins, the
resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting,
are the three great blessings of the Gospel, for
which all men hope. In the Apostles' Creed,
the expression "the Holy Catholic Church,"
stands between the words concerning God, and
those concerning man.

Now the structure of the Creed teaches that
we may not go straight from belief in the three
persons of the Holy Trinity, to belief in the
three main blessings of the Gospel, until we
have expressed our belief in the Holy Catholic
Church. We do not pass from our belief in the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, to belief
in the blessings of the Gospel, until we have
said, "I believe in the Holy Catholic Church."
The position of the words "the Holy Catholic
Church," in the Creed teaches an important
truth, viz., that it is God's will to bestow the
forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body,
and the life everlasting, *in* and *through* the Holy
Catholic Church.

It must not be thought that God deserts all
those who are outside his Church. Christ is
"the true Light, which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world."[^1] "The Spirit breatheth
