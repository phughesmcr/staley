# The ends for which the Church exists. 51

As the sap flows from the vine through the  
branches to the foliage and fruit, so his grace  
flows through the Church to her members. It  
is the office of the Church, through the agency  
of the Holy Spirit, to put men in union with,  
and to keep them in union with, Jesus Christ,  
the Author of grace.

## II. The Church, the Home of the Truth.

The Church is a divine society to which  
are entrusted the treasures of grace and truth  
for the benefit of mankind. We have seen that  
in the ages before God was made man, He was  
gradually disclosing his truth to mankind as  
they were able to bear it. This disclosing is  
commonly called 'revelation.' God's revelation  
was complete in Jesus Christ. He, as God  
made man, was "full of truth." Jesus said—  
"I am the Truth."[^1] He came to bring the  
truth in all its fulness to mankind.  
    The sum of truth was communicated by  
Christ through the Holy Spirit to the Church,  
in the person of her first leaders. To the  
apostles our Lord said,—"But the Comforter,  
which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father  
shall send in my name, He shall teach you all  
things, and bring all things to your remem-  
brance whatsoever I have said unto you;" and  
again,—"When He, the Spirit of truth, is come,  
He will guide you into all truth."[^2] In this  
manner the early Church became possessed of  
all the truth. St. Jude tells us that "the faith  
was once delivered unto the saints."[^3] The
