# The Christian Course. 321

attraction ceased, the earth would promptly fly
off into space to its destruction. So wonderfully
are these two influences balanced, that the earth
preserves its proper course. It is thus with the
movements of the will acting under Grace; only
with this difference, that Grace does not con-
strain or force the will, for Grace may be re-
sisted. Grace attracts, persuades, and aids the
will to a right choice. As St. Augustine says,
—"Not Grace alone, nor man alone, but Grace
working with man, will save:" and again "He
who created thee without thee, will not save
thee without thee."

When we see the lid of a casket forced open,
and the hinges torn away, we look upon the
work of the spoiler; but when we see the casket
gently unlocked by the key, and the contents
brought out, we note the hand of the owner.
Grace does not work by violence in opening
the heart, forcing or crushing the free action
of the will. This is not the method of Him
who comes not as a plunderer to his prey,
but as a possessor to his treasure. The will
is not blinded by Grace, but it is enlightened,
and the whole man is enabled to act with
"the glorious liberty of the children of God."[^1]
Grace does not enslave the will, but en-
franchises it.[^2]

[^1]: Rom. viii. 21.
[^2]: "The Grace of God does not make our final perseverance
inevitable. It makes it possible, probable, morally certain
if you will, but morally, not mechanically certain. God,
who has made us free, respects our freedom; He does not
crush it, even by his own merciful gifts; and Grace no more
absolutely assures heaven than does natural will or the force
of habit conquer the road to it."—Liddon, *Some Words of
Christ*, viii. p. 122.
