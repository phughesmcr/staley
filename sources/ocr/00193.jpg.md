# The Faith of the Church.

It was a tremendous crisis in the history of
the world. Would the purpose of the eternal
Word to become incarnate for us men and for
our salvation be accepted, or would his mer-
ciful design, for a time at least, be thwarted?
The immediate decision, in a certain real
sense, lay with the blessed Virgin Mary, as a
free moral agent; and we may well thank
Almighty God that she made the right de-
cision. In the face of all that awaited her,
by the grace of God, the blessed Virgin, with
perfect faith[^1] and complete self-surrender,
accepted the wondrous call of God, and uttered
the eventful words,—"Behold the handmaid of
the Lord: be it unto me according to thy
word."[^2] In that central moment, the everlast-
ing Son of the Father, who took upon him to
deliver man, did not abhor the Virgin's womb.
He began to take human form, and Mary be-
came the Mother of God.[^3]

Well may we make the words of one of
our English bishops, the pious and affectionate
Bishop Hall, our own,—"But how gladly do
we second the angel in the praise of her, which
was more ours than his! How justly do we
bless her, whom the angel pronounced blessed.
How worthily is she honoured of men, whom
the angel proclaimed beloved of God! O
blessed Mary, he cannot bless thee, he cannot
honour thee too much, that deifies thee not!
That which the angel said of thee, thou hast
prophesied of thyself: we believe the angel and
thee; 'All generations shall call thee blessed,'
by the fruit of whose womb all generations are
blessed."
