arrangements), but desired only that a memorial
of her might be made at thine altar." The
allusion here is to prayers for the dead in union
with the Eucharistic Sacrifice. St. Augustine
adds,—" May she rest, then, in peace together
with her husband. And inspire, O Lord my
God, my brethren, that so many as shall read
these pages, may at thy altar remember thy
handmaid Monica, with Patricius." [^1]

The early forms of service for the Holy
Communion are called the Primitive Liturgies.
There is not one of these which does not contain
prayers for the dead.[^2] The early liturgies
possess an authority second only to the Holy
Scriptures. We append a prayer drawn up
from expressions in the Primitive Liturgies,
to shew the kind of petitions we may safely
make to God for the faithful dead.

REMEMBER, O Lord God, the souls of
thy servants who have departed this
life in thy faith and fear, whom we remember,
or who are forgotten upon earth. Do thou
grant unto them, and unto all who rest in
Christ, a place of refreshment, of light, and of
peace, in thy kingdom, in thy paradise, in the
bosom of Abraham, where sorrow, pain and
sighing are banished away, and where the light
of thy countenance ever shineth.

[^2]: "In every form, from the solemn liturgies which embodied the belief of the Church's profoundest thinkers and truest worshippers, to the simple words of hope and love which are traced over the graves of the poor, her voice went up without a doubt or misgiving, in prayers for the souls of the departed."—Plumptre, *The Spirits in Prison*, p. 25.
