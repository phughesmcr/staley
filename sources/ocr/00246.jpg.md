# The Faith of the Church. 229

with our bodies as well as with our souls, and
"we must all appear before the judgment seat
of Christ; that every one may receive the things
done in his body, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or bad." [^1]

JUDGMENT. In the hour of death the soul
goes before God for his judgment. Upon this
particular judgment, the condition of the soul
during the time of waiting, previous to the
resurrection of the body, depends.

The general judgment, in the presence of the
assembled universe, will follow the resurrection
of the dead. The purpose of the second judgment appears to be that all may be satisfied
as to the justice of the sentence of the Judge,
and that the soul's degree of eternal bliss or
woe may be settled.

HELL is the place and penal condition "prepared for the devil and his angels." [^2] Hell was
never intended for man, and he can only arrive
there through a wilful, deliberate, and continued
rejection of God and goodness. St. Bernard
has beautifully written, "What doth God hate
or punish except self-will? Let self-will cease,
and hell will not be." We may hold it for a
certainty that none will be doomed to such an
awful destiny but those of whom our most
merciful Saviour must say,â€”"They have both
seen and hated both me and my Father," [^3] and
in this attitude of soul have died, and remain.
Hell is the condition of those who are wilfully
and finally impenitent.
