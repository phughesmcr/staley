# 372 Worship.

3. It goes by the name of Churching, because
it takes place at the mother's first visit to the
church after her delivery.

4. God's House should always be the first
house she enters. In some parts of the country
the neighbours would not allow her to enter
their houses until she had first been to church
'to pay her vows.'

5. Israelitish mothers had to go to the temple
at Jerusalem for this purpose, no matter in
what part of the holy land they lived,â€”often,
therefore, at great cost and inconvenience.
Christian mothers now-a-days should therefore
think but little of any slight trouble they may
be put to.

6. This short office should take place im-
mediately before a public service. But the
clergy should be told before such service begins,
lest the proper time pass by.

7. The Prayer Book says that the woman
"shall come decently apparelled." This does
not refer to the quality of her clothing; for it
does not matter how poor it is, if it be clean.
But it points to the old custom of wearing a veil
on this occasion, which it may not now be de-
sirable to enforce. It does however lend the
sanction of the Church to the practice of wear-
ing veils, as garments of a religious character,
at Confirmations, and at other times.

8. As soon as the clergy take their places in
church, the woman should step forward, and
kneel down at the chancel-step, where the office
will be said for her, as being the most 'con-
venient place.'
