# ST. AUGUSTINE'S CHAIR IN CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL.

In this chair "for many generations the primates of England have
all been enthroned; and which, though probably of a later date
may yet be rightly called 'St. Augustine's Chair,' for though not
the very one in which he sate, it no doubt represents the ancient
episcopal throne in which, after the fashion of the bishops of that
time, he sate behind the altar (for that was its proper place, and
there, as is well known, it once stood), with all his clergy round
him, as may still be seen in several ancient churches abroad."

Stanley, *Memorials of Canterbury*, 1855, p. 22.
