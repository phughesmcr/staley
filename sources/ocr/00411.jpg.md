"It is an entire perversion of the whole question that some have ventured to speak of 'priestly power,' 'spiritual independence,' 'sacerdotal rights,' &c. If a physician goes about to minister to the sick, bind up the broken, apply to the cure of diseases the medicines which God has given him the knowledge and the skill to use, no one speaks of 'assumption of power;' no one thinks it a part of 'independence' to die neglected. Why then speak of 'priestly power,' when people ask the ministers of God to impart that with which God has entrusted them? Why is it undue 'power' to bind up the broken-hearted, to pour into their wounds the wine and oil of penitence, to lift them up when desponding, to loose them, in Christ's name, from the chains of their sins, and encourage them anew to the conflict? Why, but that to those who know not what the conflict is, what sin is, who have no idea of mental sickness, or anxiety, or distress, all, both sickness and remedy, must seem a dream? To minister to bodily wants is accounted a benefit; to minister to spiritual, which men know not of, is a reproach! In the world, 'they that exercise lordship over them are called benefactors:' but even an apostle had occasion to say, 'Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?'"
