# The Faith of the Church. 189

The cross and passion of our Lord is the
medium of a great revelation: it reveals,—

i. *The malice and deadly impiety of sin*; shewing
   what all sin leads to, and what alone can
   expiate it,—the death of Christ, the Son
   of God.

ii. *God's hatred of sin*; teaching that God's
    attitude towards sin is one of detestation
    and wrath. If He underwent such shame
    and pain to destroy sin, how He must
    hate sin!

iii. *God's love to sinners*; if He willed to die to
     save sinners, how He must love sinners!

   "O love of God! O sin of man!
   In this dread act your strength is tried;
   And victory remains with love;
   For He, our love, is crucified!"
                                F. W. FABER.

# 6. The Descent into Hell.

"He descended into Hell."

At three o'clock on Good Friday our blessed
Saviour died on the cross, and from this time
until the morning of Easter-day, a period of
some forty hours, his soul remained separated
from his body. It was during this interval that
the soul of Jesus "descended into hell." The
word *hell* in the Creed, signifies 'the under-
world,' or 'the unseen world.' It does not mean
the place of torment reserved for the devil and
his angels, but the abode of departed spirits,
of which our Lord had spoken to the penitent
thief under the name of "paradise."
