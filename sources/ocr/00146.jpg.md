# The Anglican Principle as to the Truth. 127

to the private sense of individuals, but accord-
ing to the uniform teaching of the Church."¹
Thus Holy Scripture and Catholic tradition are
joint and mutually corrective sources of the
faith. The faith was delivered to the saints,
and given to the Church, before the New Testa-
ment was written ; yet the whole faith so given
was, by God's providence, afterwards contained
in Scripture. The Church received her faith
before she received her Scriptures, yet the whole
of the faith so received can be proved by Scrip-
ture.² When the Christian revelation was
written down and accepted by the Church, the
Church became its interpreter, being constituted
by God for this purpose, and being aided by the
Holy Spirit in fulfilling it.

It will be seen that the Catholic principle, as
we have stated it, is the safeguard against the
results of the two erroneous methods of arriving
at the truth, stated at the beginning of this
chapter.

To this Catholic principle, the English Church
committed herself unreservedly at the time of
the Reformation : to this principle, our great
divines appealed all through Reformation times:

¹ *The Rule of Faith*, p. 36.
² "Concerning the divine and sacred mysteries of the
faith, we ought not to deliver even the most casual remark
without the Holy Scriptures. Do not then believe me be-
cause I tell you these things, unless you receive from the
Holy Scriptures the proof of what is set forth : for this salva-
tion, which is of our faith, is not by ingenious reasonings,
but by proof from the Holy Scriptures. . . . For the
present, commit to memory the faith, and expect at the
fitting season the proof of each of its parts from the divine
Scriptures."—St. Cyril, *Cat. Lect*. iv. 5, 17 ; v. 12.
