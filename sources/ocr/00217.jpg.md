# 198 The Faith of the Church.

permit our Lord to come forth,—He had al-
ready done so before the stone was removed,—
but to enable the holy women to see into the
empty sepulchre. Instead of finding, as they
expected, the lifeless form lying wrapped in the
grave-clothes, they beheld an angel who said
"Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was cruci-
fied: He is risen: He is not here: behold the
place where they laid him."¹ Hurrying away
in utter astonishment, the women carried the
news to the apostles. St. Peter and St. John
at once set off to see for themselves; arriving
at the tomb, they looked in, and beheld the
grave-clothes lying as an empty envelope,
which, without being unrolled, had collapsed
with the weight of the spices, after the body
had been withdrawn, and the napkin in the form
of an empty helmet lying a little apart, the
distance from the shoulders to the lower part of
the face of the dead.²

This was not the first time that the dead had
come back to life, many cases of resurrection
being recorded in the Bible; but our Lord's
rising again to life differed from all such. These
risings to life were in every instance brought
about by the power of another, and the person
thus raised died again. But Jesus Christ rose
from the dead by his own power, through his
Spirit, and never to die again. His own words
are,—"I have power to lay down (my life), and
I have power to take it again,"³ and, "I am He
that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am
alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of
hell and of death."⁴
