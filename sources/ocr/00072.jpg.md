## 52 The ends for which the Church exists.

word "once," here means literally "once for all,"
or "once only." The Church might be called
upon to explain and enlarge upon the faith thus
given, but she could never add to it.

This faith or truth was "delivered unto the
saints," i.e., to the Church as its divinely-
appointed guardian. The truth of God was
too precious a treasure to be cast loose among
mankind, and so left to take its chance in the
world. It needed a home in which it might be
preserved free from human error, and a guardian
which should keep it and hand it down unim-
paired to future ages. Such a home and such
a guardian is "the Church of the living God,
the pillar and ground of the truth."[^1] As Dr.
Gore says,—"It is conceivable that our Lord
might have proclaimed a certain body of truth,
and then left it to make its own way, to advance
by its own weight among mankind. He might
have scattered truth at random, like 'bread
upon the waters,' over the area of human need.
But in fact He did something different, He
enshrined the truth deliberately in an organized
society."[^2]

It is the office of the Church to explain aright
Christ's teaching. This duty she is enabled to
fulfil through the aid of the Holy Ghost, who
abides with the Church. Man needs a trust-
worthy teacher of the doctrine of Christ; such
a teacher is the Church of God. She is a teacher
holding a divine warrant, and her warrant rests
upon the words of her Lord,—"Go ye there-
fore, and teach all nations, baptizing them . . .
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you
