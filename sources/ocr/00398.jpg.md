# Worship. 379

6. Remember always to take your Prayer
Book to a funeral. When you take your place
in church, kneel down, as before any other
service, for private prayer. Be ready to rise,
without being told, when the psalm begins, and
join quietly in the responses. Others will follow
your example. Avoid the foolish and unmean-
ing habit of leaning forward, and burying the
face in the hands as you sit.

7. In the churchyard, do your best to repress
all talking. And do not press forward to look
into the grave; this habit is very unbecom-
ing. Let the immediate mourners have quiet
possession of the grave-side; when they have
retired, you may take a last look at the resting-
place of your friend.

8. It is much to be desired that all would
join intelligently and devoutly in the closing
prayers, which are so moving and solemn,
of course responding, all the men uncovering
their heads.

9. The solemnity, as well as the consolation,
is immensely heightened, when the service can
be choral; and arrangements for some singing
might frequently be made, when desired.

10. Still more desirable is a special celebra-
tion of the Holy Eucharist for the repose of the
soul of the departed, as well as for the comfort
of those who survive. One of the prayers of
the Burial Office, called 'the collect,' points to
a mortuary celebration, at which it would
naturally be used.

11. Everything connected with the subse-
quent state of the grave, such as the design of
