# 382 Worship.

9. On receiving the chalice, take hold of it
firmly, by grasping its stem, in order to guide
it to your lips, and to prevent accidents. On
no account receive it with a jerk, or let go of
it suddenly.

10. When waiting in the chancel for room at
the altar, kneel rather than stand.

11. After returning to your place, kneel and
engage in private thanksgiving and prayer. If
kneeling becomes irksome, stand a while. But
never *sit* after the consecration of the Blessed
Sacrament.

12. Do not leave the church until the clergy
have left the altar. It is best to make your
thanksgiving before you depart.
