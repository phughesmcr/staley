# The Holy Bible.

the Gospels are appointed by the English
Church to be read daily throughout the year,â€”
at the Holy Eucharist, and at Matins or at
Evensong.

(2) The Acts of the Apostles, written by St.
Luke as the second part or continuation of his
Gospel, forms the first history of the Church.
In this book we have the record of the begin-
nings of the Christian Church on the Day of
Pentecost. We read of what the apostles said
and did immediately after our Lord's ascension,
and the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the
Church; then of St. Peter's work; then of St.
Paul's wonderful conversion, of his travels as
a missionary apostle, and how he planted the
Church wherever he went, leaving behind him
in each centre clergy to carry on his work.
This book gives the account of our Lord's ad-
ministration of his Church or kingdom, through
the Holy Ghost, from his throne in heaven.

(3) The Epistles. The Epistles, or 'letters,'
as the word means, comprise the writings of
St. Paul, St. James, St. Peter, St. John, and St.
Jude. Some of these letters were written to
private individuals, as, for example, St. Paul's
Epistles to St. Timothy and St. Titus; others
were addressed to congregations of Christians in
a city or a district, such as St. Paul's Epistles to
the Romans and the Corinthians; whilst others
again were written to the Church generally, and
hence are known as the Catholic or General
Epistles.

(4) The Revelation. This book contains the
letters to the Seven Churches of Asia, and a
series of visions made known to the aged apostle
St. John, whilst an exile in the Isle of Patmos,
