"salvation is of the Jews;"[^2] for the Jewish
Church was the covenanted sphere of God's
favour, and the home of his truth. Though
promises to the nations outside the Jewish
Church were given, they also depended upon
the coming of the Deliverer, the Son of God
made man.

law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy,
but to fulfil."[^4] He was born and lived on
earth within the bounds of the Jewish Church,
