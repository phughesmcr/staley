# Introduction. 7

with its scriptures, laws, sacrifices, and rites;
and in his own person gave to them a fuller
meaning, and a new power to save and to heal
the souls of men. In his person, and through
his grace, the old types passed into new and
living realities. Thus the Christian Church
grew out of the old religion, as the leaves
and flowers of a plant grow out of the stem.
The Christian Church lay in the womb of the
Jewish Church, and was its offspring. Our
Lord himself clearly taught this continuity
between the two Churches, by speaking of the
Christian Church as "Israel."[^1] There is but
one Israel, or chosen people, from the beginning
to the end.

God's purposed dealings with mankind through
Christ, were too wonderful to be carried into
effect without due warning. There was need
of long and careful preparation for the In-
carnation, and its application in the Christian
Church. This preparation was made by God
by means of the Jewish Church. Its great
work was to prepare the way for Christ,
and for God's fullest revelation of truth, and
his richest outpouring of grace in Christ.
"The law was our schoolmaster to bring us
unto Christ."[^2]

The prophecies, types, and figures of the Old
Testament find their fulfilment in Christ him-
self, and the Christian Church.

The revelation of the Old Testament is com-
pleted in that of the New Testament.

The old sacrifices are fulfilled in the sacrifice
of the Lamb of God on Calvary, and its con-
tinual application in the Holy Eucharist.
