# The ends for which the Church exists. 55

blessedness, but that the Church of God ever  
has had, and the rest of mankind never have  
had, authoritative documents of truth, and  
appointed channels of communication with him.  
The Word and the Sacraments are the char-  
acteristic of the elect people of God . . ."[^1]

When men realize that the Church is a divine  
institution, the body of Christ, the temple and  
the organ of the Holy Ghost, the covenanted  
sphere of grace and truth, it becomes to them  
a matter of the highest importance to know  
where the Church is, that they may belong to  
it, and so be within the Ark of Safety.

pp. 79, 80.
