# The Divisions in the Church. 57

one world-wide society which Christ described
as "my Church."[^1]

The unity of the Church rests upon Jesus
Christ, its divine founder and head. The
Church is one in itself, because it is one with
him. The Church is one *in* him, and one *with*
him. Of this unity the episcopate, or order of
bishops, is the pledge. This is the view taken
by St. Cyprian in his great work "on the Unity
of the Church." In commenting on St. Paul's
words,—"There is one body, and one Spirit,
even as ye are called in one hope of your
calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one
God and Father of all . . . ,"[^2] St. Cyprian
writes,—"This unity firmly should we hold
and maintain, especially our bishops, presiding
in the Church, in order that we may approve
the episcopate itself to be one and undivided.
Let no one deceive the brotherhood by false-
hood; no one corrupt the truth of our faith by
a faithless treachery. The episcopate is one;
it is a whole, in which each enjoys full posses-
sion. The Church is likewise one, though she
be spread abroad and multiplies with the
increase of her progeny; even as the sun has
many rays, yet one light; and the boughs of
a tree are many, yet its strength is one, seated
in the deep lodged root: and as when many
streams flow down from one source . . . unity
is preserved in the source itself."[^3]

St. Cyprian teaches that the unity of the
Church depends upon the unity of the order
of bishops sent by Christ, and upon the sacra-
