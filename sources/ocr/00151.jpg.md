"THE COURSE OF GODLINESS IS MADE UP OF
THESE TWO; PIOUS DOCTRINES, AND GOOD WORKS:
NEITHER ARE THE DOCTRINES WITHOUT GOOD
WORKS ACCEPTABLE TO GOD; NOR ARE WORKS
ALLOWABLE WORKS DONE APART FROM PIOUS
DOCTRINES."—*The Catechetical Lectures of St.
Cyril*, iv. 2.

"NEXT TO A SOUND RULE OF FAITH, THERE
IS NOTHING OF SO MUCH CONSEQUENCE AS A
SOBER STANDARD OF FEELING IN MATTERS OF
PRACTICAL RELIGION: AND IT IS THE PECULIAR
HAPPINESS OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND TO
POSSESS, IN HER AUTHORIZED FORMULARIES, AN
AMPLE AND SECURE PROVISION FOR BOTH."—
*Advertisement to 'The Christian Year,' by the Rev.
John Keble.*
