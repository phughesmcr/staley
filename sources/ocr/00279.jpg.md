# 262 The Sacraments.

He said,— "Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God."[^1] The kingdom of God here named, is
the kingdom of the Incarnation, the realm of
grace. By Holy Baptism we are incorporated
into the mystical body of Christ, for we are
"baptized into Christ."[^2] In this sacrament,
the germ of the new life in Christ is implanted
in the soul. "Baptism doth also now save
us."[^3] It saves us from the ill effects of our
natural descent from the first Adam: it places
us in a state or condition in which, if we con-
tinue, we shall finally be saved.

On this account it is reasonable to baptize
infants, for they cannot too soon be transferred
from a natural state to a state of grace. To
delay baptism, is to give time and opportunity
for the old nature to grow, and to gain mastery
in the soul.

The effect of Baptism is threefold:

1. It remits all sin, original and actual.

2. It bestows sanctifying grace, and endues
   the soul with the heavenly virtues of
   faith, hope, and charity.

3. It makes the recipient a member of Christ,
   the child of God, and an inheritor of the
   kingdom of heaven.

The use of water symbolises the process of
cleansing, and the word baptism signifies
'washing.'[^4] St. Paul describes Baptism as

[^1]: St. John iii. 5.
[^2]: Gal. iii. 27.
[^3]: 1 St. Peter iii. 21.
[^4]: Bede, in his *Ecclesiastical History*, describes the baptism of the Northumbrians by Paulinus in the words,—"He washed them with the water of absolution."
