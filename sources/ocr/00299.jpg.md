282                 The Sacraments.

anywhere:¹ "We have no such custom, neither
the Churches of God."

The historical evidence for the practice of
fasting Communion is so continuous and com-
plete, that the Rev. F. W. Puller, who has studied
the subject very carefully, is only able to find one
exception from the general rule of fasting Com-
munion from the close of the first century to the
Reformation,—a period of nearly 1,500 years.
This exception was in the case of some Egyptian
Christians, who received the Sacrament after
supper. Their conduct is mentioned by the his-
torians Socrates and Sozomen in terms of con-
demnation, and as a breach of an universal usage.

To prove the universality of the custom, we
quote the words of St. Augustine,—"It clearly
appears (from the account in St. Matthew's
Gospel) that, when the disciples first received
the body and blood of the Lord, they did not
receive fasting. Must we therefore censure the
universal Church, because the Sacrament is
always received by persons who are fasting?
Nay, verily; for from that time it has seemed
good to the Holy Ghost that, in honour of so
great a sacrament, the body of the Lord should
enter the mouth of a Christian before other
food: and it is for this reason that the custom
referred to is observed throughout the whole

¹ "It was a rule in the African Church to receive the
Eucharist fasting at all times, except one day, which was
the Thursday before Easter, commonly called Cœna Domini,
because it was the day on which our Saviour celebrated his
last Supper, and instituted the Eucharist after supper: in
imitation of which, it was the custom to celebrate the
Eucharist after supper on this day, in the African churches,
but on no other day whatsoever."—Bingham's *Antiquities*,
xv. 7. 8.
