## V. The Three Theological Virtues.

Of the Three Theological Virtues, St. Paul speaks in 1 Cor. xiii. 13, "And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity." They are called Theological Virtues, because God is the object of these virtues. Faith has for its object the truth revealed by God: Hope has for its object the gifts bestowed on us by God: Charity has for its object God himself.

i. Faith is the gift of God,—the virtue infused into our souls, by which we firmly believe all that God has revealed and made known to us through the Scriptures, as they are interpreted by the Church. Faith rests upon the truthfulness of God.

ii. Hope is the gift of God,—the virtue by which we expect that God will give us all things which are necessary to bring us to eternal life. Hope rests on the promises, the mercy, and the power of God.

iii. Charity is the gift of God,—the virtue by which we love God above all things, because He is infinitely good, and for his sake our neighbour as ourselves. Charity rests on the infinite goodness of God, and grows by thankfulness for his love. "We love him, because He first loved us." [^1]
