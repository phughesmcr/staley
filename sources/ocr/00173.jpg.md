# The Faith of the Church.

## 5. The Fatherhood of God.

God is eternally the Father of his only-
begotten Son. That is to say, independently
of his relationship to the universe and created
life, God has ever been the Father. There
never was a time when He was not the
Father of the eternal Son. But in a secondary
sense, it is true that Jesus Christ, as the Son
of Man, was begotten of his Father in time:
as it is written, "Thou art my Son, this day
have I begotten thee."[^1] And this is explained
by the fact that Jesus Christ, as man, had
no father but God. Thus, not only in his
divine nature, but in his human nature also,
Jesus Christ was in a peculiar sense the Son
of God.

As a truth flowing out of that which we have
stated, God is our Father. If God is the Father
of all men, in the sense that all men are his
offspring, He is nevertheless, in a more excellent
manner, the Father of Christians, through their
union with his only-begotten, incarnate Son.
"When the fulness of the time was come, God
sent forth his Son, made of a woman . . . that
we might receive the adoption of sons: and
because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the
Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba,
Father."[^2] The Son of God was made Son of
Man, in order that the sons of men may become
sons of God.[^3] In Holy Baptism we are made
members of Christ, and the children of Godâ€”
children of God, because members of Christ,
the only-begotten Son of God.
