# 268 The Sacraments.

bread for a memorial, even an offering made by
fire unto the Lord." This passage relates to
the shewbread, which was placed out of sight
of the people in the Holy Place. The twelve
cakes were to be for a memorial before the
Lord, not for a memorial before man. God
said,—"Thou shalt set upon the table shew-
bread before me alway."[^1] The purpose of
the twelve cakes of the shewbread was to
present before God the twelve tribes, which
formed his chosen people. The word trans-
lated 'memorial,' is the same as that used by
our Lord when He said,—"This do in re-
membrance of me."

In Numbers x. 10, we read,—"In the day of
your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in
the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow
with the trumpets over your burnt offerings,
and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;
that they may be to you for a memorial before
your God: I am the Lord your God" (see also
verse 9). The word here translated 'memorial,'
is the same as that used by our Lord, and
translated 'remembrance.' It is used of a
memorial, not before man, but before God.

In Heb. x. 3, we read,—"But in those sacri-
fices there is a remembrance again made of
sins every year." The allusion is to the sacri-
fices offered yearly on the Day of Atonement.
These sacrifices were offered to God, to procure
pardon of the sins of the priesthood and of the
nation. The high priest entered the Holy of
Holies, where, unseen by man, he made "a
remembrance of sins" before God. The same
word is again used.
