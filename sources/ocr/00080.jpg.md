# The Divisions in the Church.

at Nicæa A.D. 325, to which we referred on
page 39.

As the Creed left the Council, it concluded
with the words,—"And I believe in the Holy
Ghost." On the rise of a new and dangerous
heresy which denied the Godhead of the Holy
Ghost, a second General Council was called.
One hundred and fifty bishops assembled at
Constantinople, A.D. 381, and proceeded to
enlarge upon the Creed of Nicæa. In its
completed form, the conclusion of the Creed
ran thus,—"And I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Lord, and the Giver of Life, who proceedeth
from the Father, who with the Father and the
Son together is worshipped and glorified, who
spake by the prophets. And I believe One
Catholic and Apostolic Church, I acknowledge
one Baptism for the remission of sins, and I
look for the Resurrection of the dead, and the
Life of the world to come."

It will be observed that the words "and the
Son" (in Latin "filioque"), to which we are
accustomed, coming after "Who proceedeth
from the Father," are here omitted. As the
Creed was accepted by the Council, 'the filioque
clause' was not yet added.

How did the words "and the Son" find their
way into the Nicene Creed, as we now know it
in the West? "It was first introduced in reciting
the Creed in Spain, apparently from ardent zeal
in resisting the Arian heresy which had spread
there in great force. The use extended from
thence into France and Italy, and after a while
the Roman see accepted and sanctioned it.
This occurred in Charlemagne's time."[^1]
