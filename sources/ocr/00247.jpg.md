# 230 The Faith of the Church.

Faber's beautiful words concerning those out-
side the Church may be applied to the lost,—
"I have no profession of faith to make about
them, except that God is infinitely merciful to
every soul, and that no one ever has been, or
ever can be, lost by surprise or trapped in his
ignorance; and, as to those who may be lost,
I confidently believe that our heavenly Father
threw his arms round each created spirit, and
looked it full in the face with bright eyes of
love, in the darkness of its mortal life, and that
of its own deliberate will it would not have
him." [^1]

HEAVEN is the place and the blessed condition
of unending happiness in the presence of God,
and his holy angels and saints. The happiness
of heaven consists chiefly in the sight and pos-
session of God,—the blest will "see the king
in his beauty," and that for ever and ever. It
consists also in an endless reunion with all we
have loved below, who have died in grace, and
in our being perfectly good and holy for ever-
more. All who depart this life in a right relation
to God will be in heaven at last.

To which happiness may God, of his infinite
mercy, bring every reader of this book.
