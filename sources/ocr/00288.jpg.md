expressions used of 'the sacrifices of Masses'

clause 'in the which it was commonly said,'
show that what the Article speaks of is not
'the sacrifice of the Mass,' but the habit of
trusting to the purchase of Masses when dying,
to the neglect of a holy life, or repentance, and
the grace of God and his mercy in Christ Jesus,

upon the cross, even as Christ himself presents
the same offering in heaven. Thus, the fathers
