# The Sacraments. 279

Saviour Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sins, and
which the Father of his goodness raised up."—*ad Smyrn. vii.*

"There is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ and one cup
unto union in his blood—one altar."—*ad Phil. iv.*

## ST. JUSTIN MARTYR. A.D. 150.

"For we do not receive them as ordinary food, or ordinary
drink, but as by the word of God, Jesus Christ our Saviour
was made flesh, and had both flesh and blood for our salva-
tion; so also, the food which was blessed by the prayer of
the word which proceeded from him, and from which our
flesh and blood, by assimilation, receive nourishment, is,
we are taught, both the flesh and blood of that Jesus who
was made flesh."—*Apol. i. 66.*

"The oblation of the flour, which was commanded to be
offered for those who were cleansed from leprosy, was a type
of the bread of the Eucharist, which Jesus Christ our Lord
commanded us to offer, in remembrance of the Passion
which He underwent for those who purify their souls from
all sin. Hence God speaks thus by Malachi (i. 10, 11) of
the sacrifices then offered by you; 'I have no pleasure in
you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering
at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the
going down of the same my name shall be great among the
Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto
my name, and a pure offering.'"—*Dial. 41.*

## ST. IRENÆUS. A.D. 175.

"For as the bread which is from the earth, on receiving
the invocation of God is no longer common bread, but
Eucharist, consisting of two things, an earthly and a
spiritual, so our bodies, by partaking of the Eucharist, are
no longer corruptible, in that they have a hope of resur-
rection."—*against Heresies, iv. 18. 5.*

"Teaching his disciples to offer to God firstfruits from
his own creatures, He took that bread which is part of the
creation, and gave thanks, saying, 'This is my body,' and
similarly declared the cup, which is part of the creation that
we know of, to be his blood; and taught us the new oblation
of the new covenant, which the Church, receiving from the
apostles, offers throughout the whole world to God."—
*against Heresies, iv. 17. 5.*
