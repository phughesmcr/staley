# 312 Prayer.

iii. "THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH, AS IT IS
IN HEAVEN."

This is the most sacred of all the seven
petitions of the Lord's Prayer, for it was the
prayer of Jesus Christ. In the Garden of
Gethsemane, on the eve of his sacrifice, Jesus
thrice prayed this prayer. God's will is a wise
and good will, and nothing can really go well
with us until we are yielding to, and fulfilling
it. Our blessed Lord said,—"My meat is to
do the will of him that sent me, and to
finish his work."[^1] God's will represents the
highest good that can happen to us, for even
the evils we suffer, work together for good to
them that love God, and keep his command-
ments. Anything which is not according to his
will is under a curse.

By "Thy will be done," we not only mean
that all God's appointments of trial, or suffer-
ing are to be patiently borne, but also that his
will may be actively carried out by us. "The
will of God is not only to be accepted, but it is
also to be fulfilled. God has given us a free
will, and we pray that in all things, great and
small, our wills may follow his, choosing that
which He chooses, and rejecting that which
He rejects. The rule of life is the same under
all circumstances,—to do God's will as we
see it.

We pray that his will may be done in earth,
as it is in heaven. In heaven it is done by the
holy angels, consciously and completely, cheer-
fully and continually.

[^1]: St. John iv. 34.
