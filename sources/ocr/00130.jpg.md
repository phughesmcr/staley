# Anglican Orders. 111

had been so greatly exaggerated in the middle
ages, as to overshadow the further offices of
a priest in baptizing, absolving, preaching,
teaching, and blessing. It was the common
idea of the time that a priest was ordained for
the sole purpose of saying mass, regardless of
other pastoral duties. In giving authority to
minister the Word of God and his holy Sacra-
ments, the reformers deliberately restored the
lost balance. The Word and the Sacraments
comprise the whole treasure of the Church, as
the sphere of grace and truth. In ordaining
men to be "faithful dispensers of the Word of
God, and of his holy Sacraments,"[^1] the Church
commits her whole treasure to their stewardship.
In "ministering the Sacraments as the Lord
hath commanded,"[^2] a priest necessarily con-
secrates and offers the Eucharist. *Secondly*,
it must be remembered that the framers of the
English Ordinal were face to face with grave
errors concerning the relation of the Eucharist
to the Sacrifice of the Cross. These errors[^3]
were current even amongst learned divines of
the time, and more common still amongst the
people. It cannot be doubted that popular
misconceptions of the true doctrine of the
Eucharist, both as regards the real presence
and the sacrifice, had their weight with the
reformers in making the change we are dis-
cussing. In this case, the English Church only
reverted to an earlier type of ordination service,
such, for example, as is found in the primitive
Roman service for the ordination of a priest
