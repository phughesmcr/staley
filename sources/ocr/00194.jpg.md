# The Faith of the Church. 175

## NOTE ON THE TITLE 'EVER-VIRGIN.'

The Church has ever held that the mother of Jesus was a virgin both before and after the birth of Jesus. St. Augustine speaks of her as "a virgin conceiving, a virgin bringing forth, a virgin dying." The title 'ever-virgin' is applied to her by St. Athanasius. The words "And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son" (St. Matt. i. 25), do not imply that she ceased to be a virgin after the birth of Jesus, or that there were other children born later. They are intended simply to make it quite plain that Joseph was not the father of Mary's child. They guard Mary's virginity up to the time of the birth of her first and only son. The term 'firstborn' does not imply a second born. There were amongst the Jews certain rites performed in reference to the first son born into a family; and thus he was called 'the firstborn' whether there were other children or not (see Ex. xiii. 2; St. Luke ii. 22, 23). The brethren of our Lord, alluded to in the Gospels, were not the children of the Virgin Mother. They are generally supposed either to have been children of Joseph by a previous marriage, or to have been the cousins of our Lord. Bishop Lightfoot, after a most careful study of the question, comes to the conclusion that they were the former. When we realize that God himself took flesh in Mary's womb, it is inconceivable that other children should afterwards have been born of her. See Bright, *St. Leo on the Incarnation*, Note 9, pp. 136, 137.

## NOTE ON THE TITLE 'MOTHER OF GOD.'

The expression 'Mother of God' is a translation of the Greek word *Theotocos*. The title was solemnly ascribed to the blessed Virgin Mary by the General Council of Ephesus, A.D. 431, to express the truth that the Son of God took our nature upon him by being born of a human mother. The Council met to condemn the heresy of Nestorius, who taught that in Christ were two persons, the person of God and the person of man; the person of God being, as he said, united some time after birth to the person of man. The Catholic faith is, that there is but one person in Christ, that of God; and that this divine person took the manhood into God in the womb of the blessed Virgin Mary. Thus the title 'Mother of God,' was given to safeguard the truth of the Incarnation. As Dr. Bright says,â€”"The Greek term (*Theotocos*), by its very form and sound, gives prominence to the Divinity of him who, as man, was born of Mary;
