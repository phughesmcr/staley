# Worship. 371

10. At the Baptism, the child's head should
be bared, to avoid the wetting of the head-dress.

11. The child is signed on the forehead with
the sign of the cross. The Church defends this
practice in her XXXth Canon, and says that
the primitive Christians (which is undeniable)
used it in all their actions. And, certainly, if
it be neither wrong nor superstitious on this
occasion, it is difficult to see how it can be so
on other occasions also.

12. There is no fee or charge for Baptism.
To exact a fee would be to commit the sin of
selling a sacrament, which conveys the grace
of God. Of course there is nothing to hinder
such as are of ability making a gift, if they are
so disposed.

13. The Baptism of a grown-up person can-
not take place at the same time as that of a
child. When any who are come to years of
discretion desire to be baptized, notice should
be given to the clergy, that they may be pro-
perly instructed and prepared.

## ii. THE CHURCHING OF WOMEN.

1. This custom among Christians corresponds
with the Purification of Women after child-birth
among the Jews, which was of divine command.

2. Whilst in Jewish times the purification of
the mother after child-birth was the prominent
idea, in Christian times that of thanksgiving
for preservation at a very dangerous time is
specially insisted on, as the title of this office
in the Prayer Book teaches.
