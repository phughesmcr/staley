### 3. The Fall of the Angels.

The angels were created in a state of sanctity, but under probation. In the distant past they were put on their trial. As to the means adopted for this ordeal we know nothing with certainty; but the Church has generally held that their temptation was to pride.[^2] Under the trial, a number of the angels fell: they were thrust out of heaven, and became fallen angels or devils. These fallen spirits St. Jude[^3] describes as "the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation." At the head of this rebel host is Satan, thought to have been one of the Cherubim, or spirits of knowledge, owning the name of Lucifer, the light-bearer. Of his fall our blessed Lord speaks in the words, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall

[^1]: In Eph. i. 21, the Greek word translated 'might,' is in the Latin 'virtutem.'

[^2]: "It seemeth that there was no other way for angels to sin, but by reflex of their understanding upon themselves; when being held with admiration of their own sublimity and honour, the memory of their subordination unto God and their dependency on him was drowned in this conceit; whereupon their adoration, love, and imitation of God could not choose but be also interrupted. The fall of angels therefore was pride."â€”Hooker, Eccl. Polity, i. 4. 3.

[^3]: verse 6.
