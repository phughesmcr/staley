# CHAPTER I.

THE CONVERSION OF ENGLAND.

THERE is perhaps no subject of greater
interest to an English Churchman, than
that which is raised by the question,—How
did the Church of God come to this land?
Various answers have been given. Some have
thought that St. Paul, in his journeyings to
the West, preached the gospel here: others,
that Joseph of Arimathea, who buried our Lord,
was the first missionary: others again, that a
British king named Lucius begged Eleutherus,
a bishop of Rome, to send Christian teachers
to this land. But there is no sufficient evidence
for any of these tales, and they are rejected by
historians as unreliable.

1.

The most probable reply to our question is
thus given by the late Dr. Bright,—"We
cannot reasonably doubt that some Christians
did pass over from Gaul (the early name of
France) to our shores during the second
century if not earlier, and planted here and
there some settlements of the Church."[^1]
