Whilst God was thus dealing with the human
race in general, He willed, in his wisdom, to
work in a more special way within a narrower
circle. At first, history tells of God's particular
dealings with individuals and families, as with
the patriarchs; then with one nation, that of
the Jews; and, lastly, when Christ came, with
all nations without distinction.

find in early times Noah thus singled out for
God's special favour. The human race had
become so utterly wicked, that it was necessary
to destroy it by a mighty flood. Noah and his
family remained faithful; and, as a reward,
God saved them in the ark from the punish-

Noah and his family, God made a covenant
or agreement,[^1] revealing himself, and giving
the primary laws of the human race. Thus the
knowledge of the true God was preserved in the
world.

But in time the descendants of Noah cor-
rupted themselves, and then God, in his mercy,
made choice of Abraham and his family. God
now began to reveal himself more fully. He
promised in solemn terms that Abraham should
be the founder of a great nation, and that in
him all families of the earth should be blessed.
