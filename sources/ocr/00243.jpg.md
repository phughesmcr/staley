Jews regularly used such prayers in their public
services, and our Lord, who attended those
services, must often have joined in them. He

words,—"the Lord grant unto him that he may
find mercy of the Lord in that day," [^3] we have
probably an example of prayer for the departed.

concerning such things as these (her burial
