# The Sacraments.

views sin as an outrage against the love of
God; he sees in the Passion and Death of
Jesus the work and the result of his sin.
Contrition is the breaking of the heart in the
thought of God's love, as it is manifested in
the Passion. True contrition places the soul
in a state of reconciliation and peace with God.
"The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a
broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou
not despise." [^1]

(2.) CONFESSION.

Contrition leads naturally to confession, or
the truthful acknowledgment of sin. Confession
is self-accusation, and the acknowledgment to
God of wrong doing. God demands confession
as a condition of pardon: "If we confess our
sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins." [^2] A willingness to confess is an evidence
of contrition. The most searching confession
is that made privately before a priest.

"It is neither prudent nor safe always to rely
upon our own judgment of ourselves, for another
Eye sees more of us than is discerned by our
own. In the dangers of our body we consult
the physician, in the intricacies of our estate
we advise with the lawyer, and in the care of
our immortal souls why do we not advise with
our spiritual physicians? for they are appointed
by Christ himself to direct the ignorant, confirm
the doubtful, and comfort the disconsolate.

"Confession to a priest is with us restored to
its primitive use, for we direct all men always
to confess to God, but some also to confess
