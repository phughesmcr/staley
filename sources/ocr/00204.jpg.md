# The Faith of the Church. 185

the penalty of sin. Thus, when we see our
Lord suffering, we know that, in some mys-
terious way, He was in contact with sin, and
suffering because of sin. He was perfectly
sinless, "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
sinners;"[^1] but, as the representative of our
guilty race, He allowed himself to be accounted
guilty, and in surrendering life in such agonies,
He bore the punishment due to our sins. In
the striking language of St. Paul, God "made
him to be sin for us, who knew no sin."[^2] Thus,
Jesus was the sin-bearer, bearing "our sins in
his own body on the tree."[^3] The prophet Isaiah
specially declared that "the Lord hath laid on
him the iniquity of us all."[^4]

This great prophecy found its first fulfilment
in our blessed Lord's agony and bloody sweat in
the garden of Gethsemane, on the night in which
He was betrayed. At the close of this terrible
conflict, Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles,
betrayed his master to his enemies for thirty
pieces of silver. Deserted by the apostles, Jesus
was taken away, and, on the next day, was led
before his judges, scourged, crowned with thorns,
and, after enduring unspeakable insults and in-
dignities, was sentenced by Pontius Pilate, the
Roman governor, to be nailed to a cross upon
which He died. All this happened upon the
first Good Friday.

The crucifixion of Jesus is the most terrible
crime which it is possible to conceive; for the
crucified was none other than God the Son,
the second person in the blessed Trinity, the
Creator and the Judge of all men.
