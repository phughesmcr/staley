# 150 The Faith of the Church.

"I Am that I Am,"[^1] and denotes the Self-
existence of God.

(b.) God is Eternal.

He has neither beginning nor ending. With
God there is neither past nor future, but an
eternal present. HE IS. The circle is the
emblem of eternity. In the centre of the
circle of eternity is God. However far back
we go, we are no nearer the beginning of the
life of God, for He has no beginning. "Before
the mountains were brought forth, or ever the
earth and the world were made, thou art God
from everlasting, and world without end."[^2]

(c.) God is Holy.

The nature of God is the essence of good-
ness. God is the Good One. "There is
none good but One, that is God."[^3] It is
because He is good, that we are able to love
and obey him. We can only love and obey
a perfect Being, and all evil is imperfection.
The worship of the angels "Holy, Holy, Holy,
is the Lord of Hosts,"[^4] is his right. The holi-
ness of God is so excellent, that "his angels He
charged with folly,"[^5] and "the heavens are not
clean in his sight."[^6]

(d.) God is Almighty.

He can do whatsoever He pleases, and that
without effort. His will is supreme. "With
God all things are possible."[^7] Yet He cannot
