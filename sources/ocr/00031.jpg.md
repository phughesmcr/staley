# CHAPTER II.

## THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH.

THERE is in our midst a vast society named
the Christian Church,—the Church of
God. If we are not already members of this
society, we are at least conscious of its presence.
What is the origin of the Christian Church;
from whence did it come; who was its founder?

"The Lord hath founded Zion."[^1] It was
through the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
and the gift of his Spirit, that the ancient
Church of God passed into its catholic or
world-wide phase on the day of Pentecost.
Jesus Christ, the Son of God made man, is
the founder of the Christian Church.

This is clear from our Lord's words to St.
Peter, when he confessed him to be the Son
of God,—"upon this rock I will build my
Church."[^2] Jesus Christ regards the Church
as his own, He speaks of it as "my Church;"
and He claims to be its founder, for He says
"I will build my Church."

It is worthy of note that this is our Lord's
first mention of the Church. It was drawn
