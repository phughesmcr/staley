# The Holy Bible. 345

off the coast of Asia Minor. These visions
concern the relation of the Church to the world,
her struggle on earth against the powers of evil,
and her final triumph in heaven.

Such is the Holy Bible. "No other book
can equally avail to prepare us for that which
lies before us; for the unknown anxieties and
sorrows which are sooner or later the portion of
most men and women; for the gradual approach
of death; for the passage into the unseen world;
for the sights and sounds which then will burst
upon us; for the period, be it long or short,
of waiting and preparation; for the throne and
the face of the eternal Judge. Looking back
from that world, how shall we desire to have
made the most of our best guide to it!" [^1]

## III. THE BIBLE AND THE CHURCH.

is as wrong as it is impossible to separate the
one from the other. If the Scriptures contain
the truth, the Church is "the pillar and ground" [^2]
upon which the truth rests. For,â€”

(1) The Church wrote the inspired books which
form the Bible.

(2) The Church separated the inspired books from
other writings.

(3) The Church alone can rightly interpret the
Bible.
