# 348 The Holy Bible.

those which he did. No code of written law is
sufficient without a court to testify to its mean-
ing, and to give the right meaning with au-
thority in case of dispute. As the laws of the
land need an interpreter in the person of the
judges, so the Bible needs the voice of the
Church to expound its meaning. When St.
Philip asked the Ethiopian nobleman, "Under-
standest thou what thou readest?" he wisely
replied, "How can I, except some man should
guide me?"[^1]

That every man should study the Bible for
himself, putting his own meaning upon its
words, cannot be a right plan; for people who
do this come to opposite conclusions as to main
truths, such as the Divinity of Christ, the
Atonement, etc. The Bible is the word of
God, but when wrongly explained it ceases to
be so, and becomes instead the word of man.
Without an interpreter the Bible becomes a
cause of angry disputes and unseemly wrangling.

Upon this subject Dr. Liddon has wisely said,

humble and sensible man will take a guide.

standeth like the strong mountains;' His judg-
ments are like the great deep' (Ps. xxxvi. 6).
Wise people do not try to climb the Alps alone,
or go to sea in a skiff without a compass. If
the Bible were a mere human book, we might
easily explore its heights and depths for our-
selves; but precisely because it is superhuman,
we may easily lose ourselves in the attempt to
explore it. He who gives us the Bible, gives
us, in the voice of that early undivided Christian
