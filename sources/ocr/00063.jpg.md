# CHAPTER IV.

GRADES AMONGST THE BISHOPS OF
THE CHURCH.

THE Christian ministry, consisting of the
three orders of bishops, priests, and
deacons, has already been shewn to be of divine
institution. It cannot therefore be changed to
any other form of ministry, and it will continue
to be *the ministry* of the Church until the end
of the world.

But as the Church grew and spread in the
world, it was found convenient to make dis-
tinctions of rank in each of the three orders
of the ministry. This was specially the case
with the bishops, the chief ministers of the
Church.

In early times bishops were much more
numerous than they are now. Every city had
its bishop, and at first all bishops were equal.
But as time went on, it came about quite natur-
ally that the greater the city, the greater was
the dignity of its bishop; the rank or civil
importance of the city passing on to its bishop.
And it followed quite naturally, too, that the
bishops of smaller towns in surrounding districts
or provinces, placed themselves under the pro-
tection and guidance of those of the greater
cities. This is the origin of what is known
