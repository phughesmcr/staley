## The Ministry of the Church.

Thus we see, that the episcopate is the
warrant or guarantee of sacramental grace.
Those bodies of Christians who have lost the
apostolic succession, have lost with it the
divine warrant of such grace. God may excuse
those who act in ignorance, and He may reward
their faith by some gift of grace; but if so,
it is as outside the covenant, and such grace
is 'uncovenanted grace,' and there is an element
of uncertainty about it.

To sum up what has been said in this chapter,
we may add, that to be united to the Body of
Christ, which is the Church,—to know the
truth,—to be assured that we are within the
covenanted sphere of grace,—it is needful to
place ourselves under the rule, guidance, and
ministry of the bishops of the Church of God.
In the words of St. Ignatius,—

"WHERE THE BISHOP APPEARS, THERE LET
THE PEOPLE BE, AS WHERE JESUS CHRIST IS,
THERE IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH."[^1]
