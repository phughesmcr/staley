# CHAPTER V.

## ANGLICAN ORDERS.

THE claim of any body of Christians to be a
portion of the Catholic Church, stands or
falls by the Apostolic succession. Apart from
this succession there is no reliable ministry of
the Word and the Sacraments.[^1] The possession
of a ministry in direct line with the apostles, and
the maintenance of the Catholic Faith, makes the
difference between the Church and a sect. Thus
the question of the validity of our orders, i.e.,
whether the clergy of the English Church are
rightly ordained, is one of vital importance.
Valid consecration is the corner-stone of the
whole ecclesiastical edifice.

As an historical fact, the apostolic succession
was continued without break in the English
Church all through the Reformation times, by
bishops of the old apostolic line. As this state-
ment has been disputed, it is necessary to
produce proofs of its truth.

[^1]: "The principle of apostolic succession is that no man
in the Church can validly exercise any ministry, except such
as he has received from a source running back ultimately to
the apostles, so that any ministry which a person takes upon
himself to exercise, which is not covered by an apostolically
received commission, is invalid."â€”Gore, *The Mission of the
Church*, p. 31.
