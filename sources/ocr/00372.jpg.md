# Worship. 353

ii.

Worship being the offering of the creature to
the Creator, it necessarily follows that it should
be of the very best. The instinct of the Church
from the first has recognized this principle, and
thus we find that she has all along, according to
opportunity, offered to God the choicest gifts of
nature and of art. The Church also lays down
carefully considered rules as to the ceremonies
of divine worship, believing that no detail in the
service of her King is too trifling to be con-
sidered.

Whilst thus ordering outward things, the
Church has ever insisted on the necessity of a
worship in which the soul bears a real and
serious part. God, who ordered an elaborate
ceremonial for his ancient Church, is repre-
sented by the prophet Isaiah (i. 10-16) as hating
such a worship, when unaccompanied by devo-
tion of heart and holiness of life. But we must
remember that the abuse of a thing is no argu-
ment against its right use.

When heaven was opened to St. John the
Divine, and he was permitted to see the worship
above, he described, in symbolical language, a
worship of which beautiful ceremonies formed
an important part. No worship can possibly
be more spiritual than that of heaven. We
cannot therefore do wrong in making the
heavenly worship thus described our model ; for
the worship of the Church below is offered to
the same God, and, moreover, it forms our
preparation for joining in the worship of heaven
in eternity.
