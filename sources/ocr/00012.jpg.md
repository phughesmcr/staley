viii                         Preface.

Bishops of the Church, a subject which he has made
specially his own: to the Rev. George Sowden, Hon.
Canon of Wakefield, for permission to reprint the Notes
on the Church Offices, with slight alterations: to the
Council of the Church House, who have so courteously
permitted a reproduction of the design of the Seal of that
Institution: to Mr. George Richmond, R.A., and to the
London Autotype Co. for permission to copy Mr. Dyce's
drawing of Archbishop Parker's consecration: and lastly to
a kind friend who has bestowed great labour in preparing
the MS. for the press. The author begs to thank the many
friends who have subscribed to allow of the insertion of the
illustrations, without adding to the cost of the publication.

In reference to the Second Part of the Book, the author
wishes to say that it is not intended to give a full account of
the history of the English Church, but only a general out-
line, whereby the reader may be able to see how things have
come to be as they are.

In the necessary treatment of matters of controversy, he
desires to withdraw any word which may be lacking either
in charity, or in perfect fairness.
