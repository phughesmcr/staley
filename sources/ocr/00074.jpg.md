# 54 The ends for which the Church exists.

"All knowledge of religion is from (God), and not only that which the Bible has transmitted to us. There never was a time when God had not spoken to man, and told him to a certain extent his duty. . . We are expressly told in the New Testament, that at no time He left himself without witness in the world, and that in every nation He accepts those who fear and obey him. It would seem, then, that there is something true and divinely revealed, in every religion all over the earth, overloaded, as it may be, and at times even stifled by the impieties which the corrupt will and understanding of man have incorporated with it. Such are the doctrines of the power and presence of an invisible God, of his moral law and governance, of the obligation of duty, and the certainty of a just judgment, and of reward and punishment, as eventually dispensed to individuals; so that revelation, properly speaking, is an universal, not a local gift; and the distinction between the state of Israelites formerly and Christians now, and that of the heathen, is, not that we can, and they cannot attain to future

faith in Christ and fervent love to him belong to the soul of the Church also, or who, although not in the body of the Church shall not, through their own fault, have ceased to be in the body, and shall belong to its soul, in that through faith and love they cleave to Christ its head."â€”Pusey, *The Minor Prophets*, on Joel ii. 32. In this passage Dr. Pusey is contrasting the condition of pious dissenters and others, with that of unworthy members of the Church, and considers that the former are more safe than the latter. He holds that dissenters of good life, though not members of the *body* of the Church, are nevertheless members of the *soul* of the Church; whilst Churchpeople of bad life, though members of the *body*, are not of the *soul* of the Church, and hence that the former are more acceptable to God than the latter.
