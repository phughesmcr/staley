# Worship. 381

3. Try to be in church at least five minutes
before the service at the altar begins, and if
possible, earlier still, for private devotion. If
unavoidably late, it is well, as a general rule,
not to communicate if you arrive after the
Confession.

4. When in church, remember that you are
engaged in a great act of congregational worship
and intercession, in which each member of the
'royal priesthood' should exercise his office
intelligently and heartily.

5. Fill up all intervals in the public Liturgy
with prayers and intercessions. Have suitable
books of devotion for this purpose, but learn not
to be tied down to them.

6. When the time comes for communicating,
hold yourself in readiness to go up to the altar.
Take off both your gloves, put aside your veil,
or anything else that is likely to embarrass
yourself or the priests.

7. Kneel down very reverently at the altar-
step. Say secretly again and again such words
as these,â€”" Lord, it is good for me to be
here;" or, "Lord, I am not worthy that thou
shouldest come under my roof."

8. When your own turn comes, kneel quite
upright, and prepare to receive the sacrament
of the Lord's body into the palm of your right
hand, steadied by the left, holding your hands
well up, with the fingers straight out. Keep
the hands quite still. Then receive It from
your palm with your mouth, taking care not
to leave a particle on your hand, or to let one
crumb fall to the ground.
