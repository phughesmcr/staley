# CHAPTER V.

THE ENDS FOR WHICH THE CHURCH EXISTS.

FROM what has been already said in this work, it may be gathered that the Church of God is a divine society, existing in the world for great ends. At the risk of some slight repetition, it will be useful to dwell briefly upon the chief purposes for which the Church exists in our midst.

Our blessed Lord, by his incarnation, brought the fulness of grace and truth to the earth. "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us . . . full of grace and truth." "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."[^1] He wills to bestow his grace and to make known his truth in and through his Church. In Holy Scripture, the Church is described as "the bride"[^2] or spouse of Christ. It has been said that the spouse of Christ has two breasts, the breasts of grace and truth, by which she nourishes her members. Thus we are to regard the Church as,—

I. THE SPHERE OF GRACE.
II. THE HOME OF THE TRUTH.
   and hence as,—
III. THE ARK OF SAFETY.
