"Within the Catholic Church, we hold
that which hath been believed every-
where, always, and of all men: for that
is truly and properly Catholic, which
comprehendeth all things in general after
an universal manner. And that shall we
do if we follow Universality, Antiquity,
Consent.

Universality shall we follow thus, if
we profess that One Faith to be true,
which the whole Church throughout the
world acknowledgeth and confesseth.

Antiquity shall we follow, if we part
not any whit from those senses which
it is plain that our holy elders and
fathers generally held.

Consent shall we likewise follow, if,
in this very Antiquity itself, we hold the
definitions and opinions of all, or at any
rate almost all, the Priests and Doctors
together."

Vincent of Lerins, *against Heresy*, Ch. ii.
