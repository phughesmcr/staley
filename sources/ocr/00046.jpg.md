# 26 The Ministry of the Church.

son, and bring them up unto mount Hor : and
strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
Eleazar his son. . . . And Moses stripped Aaron
of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar
his son." ¹

This custom was continued in after years,
as we learn from Exod. xxix. 29, 30,—" And
the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons'
after him, to be anointed therein, and to be
consecrated in them. And that son that is
priest in his stead shall put them on seven
days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of
the congregation to minister in the holy place."
The newly-made high priest was to wear the
vestments of his predecessor to show the con-
tinuity of the office, and to mark its complete
identity with that of his predecessor. We have
in all this a great foreshadowing of the apostolic
succession in the Christian Church.

Christ is gone up : yet ere He pass'd  
From earth, in heav'n to reign,  
He formed one holy Church to last  
Till He should come again.  

His twelve apostles first He made  
His ministers of grace ;  
And they their hands on others laid  
To fill in turn their place.  

So age by age, and year by year,  
His grace was handed on ;  
And still the holy Church is here,  
Although her Lord is gone.
