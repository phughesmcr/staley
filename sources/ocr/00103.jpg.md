# 84 The Causes of the Reformation.

kings followed the same course. The climax
to this unhappy idea of subjection to Rome
was reached in the great conflict about in-
vestitures; i.e., as to whether the pope or the
king should appoint to bishoprics. In the
weak reign of King John, Pope Innocent III.
deposed the King, and bestowed the kingdom
upon Philip of France, urging him to take
possession of England, on the ground that it
was part of the pope's empire. The quarrel
had been as to the see of Canterbury. John,
to save himself, knelt before the pope's legate,
and owned that he held his crown from the
pope, and that England, both in civil and
ecclesiastical matters, was subject to the Roman
see.

The struggle between the popes and the
sovereigns of England continued till a strong
king arose, Edward III. (1327-1377) who,
backed by bishops and nobles, decreed that
"neither John nor any other person could
subject the nation to another power without
the consent of the nation." An annual pay-
ment of one thousand marks known as the
'CENSUS,' established by King John as an
acknowledgment of the dependence of the king-
dom on the pope, ceased in consequence of this
decree.

It is needless to speak further of the struggle
between the popes and the English Government.
We will only add that the results varied accord-
ing to opportunities offered to either side,—the
popes striving to gain their own objects, the
English Government struggling for its liberties,
—the strife turning in favour of one side or the
other as the power alternated.
