# 156 The Faith of the Church.

the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters."[^1] "God created all things by
Jesus Christ."[^2] "By the Word of the Lord,"
i.e., by the Son, "were the heavens made; and
all the hosts of them by the Breath of his
mouth," i.e., by the Holy Spirit.[^3]

In the first chapter of Genesis, creation is
represented as taking place in six days. We
need not suppose that these were days of
twenty-four hours long. The expression 'day'
in the Bible is often used of more extended
periods. By the six days of creation, we may
understand vast periods of creative power, in
which our earth was being prepared for the
habitation of man. In briefly describing the
work of creation, the account appears to dwell
upon the leading feature of each period. Holy
Scripture sets before us creation as the work of
God,â€”an orderly work, in which less perfect
types of being were succeeded by more perfect
types, until the highest type was reached in
man. Some have thought that the world, as
we now see it, was created directly by God;
others, that the higher forms and organisms
with which we are familiar, were developed by
divine power out of the lower forms and
organisms which God at first made. This
idea is known as the theory of evolution. If
this should hereafter prove to be true, there is
nothing in the account given in Genesis incon-
sistent with such a theory. If the theory of
evolution be true, it can only represent the
*method* of God's working, He who alone created
all things developing them by this law of
growth.
