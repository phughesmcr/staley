# The Commandments. 237

from evil-speaking, lying, and slandering: To
keep my body in temperance, soberness, and
chastity: Not to covet nor desire other men's
goods; but to learn and labour truly to get mine
own living, and to do my duty in that state of
life, unto which it shall please God to call me.

## I. SIN.

Sin is of two kinds,—original and actual. Of
the former we have already spoken (see page
162). We will now speak of actual sin. Actual
sin is the breaking of the commandments of
God. "Sin," says St. John, "is the transgression of the law."[^1] The word *transgression*
signifies the passing the boundary line which
divides right from wrong. The sinner passes
over from the side of God to that of the devil,
and so becomes a traitor and a rebel.

St. Augustine says,—"Sin is something said,
or done, or desired in contradiction to the eternal
law." Thus, the commandments may be broken
in thought, word, or deed. We should remember that sin, to be complete, need not become
speech or action; a formed desire, deliberately
assented to by the will, constitutes sin. Sin
has its root in the will. We may sin by
omission as well as by commission, i.e., by
not doing the right, as well as by doing the
wrong.

Sin darkens the mind, pollutes the heart,
weakens the will, and separates us from God.
Sin, if persevered in, ends in death. "Sin,
when it is finished, bringeth forth death."[^2]
