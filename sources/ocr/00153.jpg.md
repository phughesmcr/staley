# 134 Christian Duty.

We promised,—  
To renounce the enemies of God,—the world,  
the flesh, and the devil :  
To believe all the articles of the Christian  
faith : and,  
To keep God's holy will and command-  
ments.  
In other words, we engaged,—  
To avoid the evil :  
To believe the truth : and,  
To do the right.  
The keeping of these promises forms our part  
in the baptismal covenant or agreement, and  
is the condition of salvation. For this reason  
it was right that these promises should be made  
in our name in baptism, even though we were  
unconscious infants at the time. The observance  
of the baptismal promises is summed up in the  
words, *Christian Duty*.  
Christian Duty comprises faith and practice,  
—what we ought to believe, and what we ought  
to do. We will first consider what we ought  
to believe, and then what we ought to do.
