# The Anglican Principle as to the Truth. 129

It was in these Councils that all the great
heresies were rejected, and the main truths of
the Catholic faith asserted.

If this be our principle as to the truth, it may
be asked,—How is it that there exists such
diversity of teaching amongst us? There is
no doubt a good deal of diversity on certain
points, not so much touching the main doctrines
of the Creed (e.g., the doctrines of the Trinity,
the Incarnation, the Atonement, or the Divinity
of the Holy Spirit), as on matters of practice,
and the mode of carrying out our services, and
the meaning given to some of our usages. This
is to some extent unavoidable, seeing that in
a great body of teachers there will be variety
of thought and feeling. Judging by St. Paul's
Epistles, we see that in the apostles' times,
there was a good deal of disagreement, and
this upon important points, which often greatly
troubled the minds of the apostles. Much of
the diversity of teaching in our midst is due to
the fact, that men teach in the Church's name
that which is not her doctrine. Amongst our-
selves there is great unwillingness to carry
authority too far, so as to crush the individual
energies of earnest men. Often truth comes out
the more clearly by allowing these differences
to appear; and we are warned by our Lord
against too great exercise of discipline, "lest
while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
the wheat with them."[^1]
