# The Faith of the Church. 145

## CREEDS (continued).

### The Creed of St. Athanasius.

One ; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh : but
by taking of the Manhood into God ;
One altogether ; not by confusion of Substance : but by
unity of Person.
For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man : so God
and Man is one Christ ;
Who suffered for our salvation :

Descended into hell,
Rose again the third day from the dead.

He ascended into heaven, He sitteth on the right hand
of the Father, God Almighty :

From whence He shall come to judge the quick and the
dead.

At whose coming all men shall rise again with their
bodies : and shall give account for their own works.
And they that have done good shall go into life everlast-
ing : and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.
This is the Catholick Faith : which except a man believe
faithfully, he cannot be saved.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy
Ghost ;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be :
world without end. Amen.
