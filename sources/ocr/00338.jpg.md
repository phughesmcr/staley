sin because we "frustrate the grace of God,"¹
and "receive the grace of God in vain."² The
very fact that the grace of God is offered to all
men, proves that He does not will that anyone
should either sin or be lost.

God does not elect all men to the same
position in his kingdom. He gives to some
ten talents, to others five, to others two; but
He gives to all one talent, and to everyone
grace to correspond to his vocation. If God
bestows his grace in a way which seems to us
unequal, yet to no one does He give less grace
than is necessary for salvation. The lot of
each soul in eternity will depend upon the use
made of that grace. Everyone is called to, and
is capable of salvation, but God alone knows
who will "make their calling and election
sure."³

## II. GRACE AND FREEWILL.

The soul of man is the seat of Freewill.
Freewill is that great gift of God to man,
whereby he is able to choose good or evil.
The possession of Freewill raises man above
all the creatures around him, and makes him
capable of corresponding with God's Grace.
The soul would be incapable of either moral
goodness or moral evil, unless it was free to
choose one or the other. Without Freewill we
should be mere machines, not moral agents
created in the image of God. There could be
no responsibility in the sight of God for our
actions, unless our wills were unfettered.
Nothing teaches more forcibly the exceeding
