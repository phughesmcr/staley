# 228 The Faith of the Church.

"As by one man sin entered into the world,
and death by sin; and so death passed upon all
men, for that all have sinned."[^1]

"Each time that death comes among us, it
should remind us of the curse of our nature and
the just punishment of our sins; but among
Christians, for whom Jesus Christ has overcome
death, it ought chiefly to speak to us of his
victory, and of the eternal kingdom to which
we journey as we leave this life."[^2]

THE RESURRECTION is the rising again of
the body in which the soul was clothed on earth.
At the last day the soul will return from the
intermediate state, and re-enter the risen body.
The body so raised will not be the natural body
as it was in this life,[^3] but a new and spiritual
body, possessing new powers, and existing under
new conditions in a new order of being, and
freed from all taint of evil and inclination to
sin. The resurrection of the dead will take
place through the power of Jesus Christ and of
his Spirit. "Marvel not at this: for the hour
is coming, in the which all that are in the graves
shall hear his voice, and shall come forth;"[^4]
"He that raised up Christ from the dead shall
also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit
that dwelleth in you."[^5]

The disembodied soul is but part of the com-
plete man. The resurrection is necessary in
order that the whole man, body and soul, may
be perfected in eternity. We do good and evil
