# 252 The Commandments.

Easter to be always one.[^1] And for better pre-
paration thereunto, as occasion is, to disburthen
and quit our consciences of those sins that may
grieve us, or scruples that may trouble us, to
a learned and discreet priest, and from him to
receive advice, and the benefit of absolution.

vi. By the ecclesiastical laws of this realm,
there be some times of the year wherein mar-
riages are not usually solemnized; as,

From | Advent | Sunday | Eight days after
| Septuagesima | until | the Epiphany.
| Rogation | | Eight days after
| | | Easter.
| | | Trinity Sunday.

[^1] The mind of the Church of England ever was, and is,
to have a communion and commemorative sacrifice of Christ's
death every day.â€”Cosin, *Works*, v. p. 124.
