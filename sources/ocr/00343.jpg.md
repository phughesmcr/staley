# The Christian Course.

otherwise expound or allege the place" (i.e.,
St. John iii. 5) "than as implying external
baptism." [^1]

St. Paul uses an expression which confirms
this interpretation. In his epistle to Titus [^2] he
writes, "According to his mercy He saved us,
by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing
of the Holy Ghost." The word here used for
'washing,' means a 'bath,' which implies the
use of water. So here again, Regeneration,
or the new birth, is associated with the use
of water,—the bath of the font. The first words
that the priest is directed to say after baptizing
a child, and receiving it into the Church, are
these,—"Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren,
that this child is regenerate." [^3] THEREFORE,
EVERY PERSON WHO HAS BEEN RIGHTLY BAP-
TIZED, HAS, THROUGH THE SPIRIT, BEEN BORN
AGAIN.

We must not think that because a person has
been born again, he will necessarily be saved.
Regeneration is not final salvation, but it places
the soul in such a relation to God as to make
salvation possible. The germ of the new life,
implanted in the soul at baptism, needs to be
cared for and developed. The new life in
Christ is as a seed within the soul, which needs
to be watered and tended, that it may live and
grow, until sin is destroyed, and the new life is
perfected. There are thus two forces at work in
the soul of the regenerate man. Good and evil
meet in the baptized, and one or other must in the
end prevail. The issue of the conflict depends
upon the will, working with, or against grace.
