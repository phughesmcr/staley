# The Ministry of the Church. 29

Church. The one order grew out of the other
as a branch of the apostolic stem. In a special
sense the bishops became successors of the
apostles, inheriting the fulness of ministerial
power. The three permanent orders were
now,—

1. BISHOPS.
2. ELDERS,[^1] or PRIESTS.
3. DEACONS.

Whatever confusion appears to exist as to
the names given to the various grades of the
Christian ministry in the New Testament, it

Christ sprang the threefold order known hence-
forth by the titles of 'bishops,' 'priests,' and
'deacons.' "Without these three orders," says
St. Ignatius (A.D. 110) "no Church has a title
to the name."[^2]

This threefold order dates from New Testa-
ment times, and has been continued through
the apostolic succession to our own days without
break. Thus in the Preface to the services for
ordaining the clergy of the Church, in the Prayer
Book, we are taught,—"It is evident unto all

Christ's Church; bishops, priests, and deacons.
Which offices were evermore had in such
reverend estimation, that no man might pre-
sume to execute any of them, except he were

[^1]: The original word for 'elder' in the New Testament
is always 'presbyter,' which was afterwards shortened to
'prester,' and then to 'priest.'
