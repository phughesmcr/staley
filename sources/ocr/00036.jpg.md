# The Ministry of the Church.

## i.

It is important that we should see wherein the difference between the priesthood of Aaron, and that of Melchisedec lay. In what way was the latter superior to the former, that it should supplant it?

The priesthood of Aaron was hereditary, being handed down from father to son; it was but for a time, and was destined to pass away. The priesthood of Melchisedec was inherent in himself, and independent of others; it was to endure unto the end of time. Moreover, there was a feature in the priesthood of Melchisedec which was wanting in that of Aaron. Aaron was a priest simply: Melchisedec was a king as well as a priest. Melchisedec is described as "king of Salem, priest of the most high God."[^1]

## ii.

The priesthood of Melchisedec was fulfilled in our Lord. In the Psalms, He is described as a "priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."[^2] In the Epistle to the Hebrews, He is five times spoken of by the same title.[^3]

When our Lord came, He took upon himself for our salvation the threefold office of prophet, priest, and king. He was anointed by the Holy Spirit in his incarnation, and at his baptism, to beâ€”

The prophet, who should teach man about God.

The priest, who should reconcile man to God.

The king, who should subdue man to God.
