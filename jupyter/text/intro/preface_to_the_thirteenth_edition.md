# Preface to the Thirteenth Edition

The re-setting of the type for the Thirteenth Edition has enabled the author to read through with carefulness the whole of the following pages, and to make several verbal alterations which suggested themselves as improvements. A distinct omission in previous editions has been supplied by the addition of a short article on "The Fatherhood of God" (page 154). The author begs to record his deep thankfulness for the continued widespread circulation of this Manual.
