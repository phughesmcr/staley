"At the arrival of Augustine the monk, about six hundred years after Christ, the Britons he found observers still of the self-same government by bishops over the rest of the clergy; under this form Christianity took root again, where it had been exiled. Under the self-same form it remained till the days of the Norman conqueror. By him and his successors it hath from that time till now been upheld."—Hooker, *Eccl. Polity*, vii. 2. 1.

## St. Augustine's Chair in Canterbury Cathedral

In this chair "for many generations the primates of England have all been enthroned; and which, though probably of a later date may yet be rightly called 'St. Augustine's Chair,' for though not the very one in which he sate, it no doubt represents the ancient episcopal throne in which, after the fashion of the bishops of that time, he sate behind the altar (for that was its proper place, and there, as is well known, it once stood), with all his clergy round him, as may still be seen in several ancient churches abroad."

Stanley, *Memorials of Canterbury*, 1855, p. 22.
