# Preface to the Sixth Edition

THE author hopes that this work has now reached its final form. He begs to thank his numerous correspondents in all parts of the world for many valuable suggestions. He has also had the advantage of much criticism, both friendly and adverse, in the press.

In this Edition considerable additions will be found, especially new articles onâ€”

- The Counsels of Perfection, a subject of much importance in view of the revival of religious communities in the Anglican Church.
- The Observance of Sunday, consisting of extracts from Dr. Liddon's sermon, The Lord's Day, reprinted by the kind permission of Messrs. Longmans, Green, and Co.
- The XXXIX. Articles, with regard to the principle of their interpretation.

The author's thanks are due to the Rev. F. E. Warren, B.D., late Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford, for the Introduction to the Kalendar, and for a revision of the Addenda to the Kalendar.

The author has revised the whole work, re-writing many of the sections, and has added numerous footnotes from the writings of Anglo-Catholic divines of acknowledged repute.

It has been his earnest endeavour to teach nothing as matter of faith which will not bear the test laid down in the famous rule of Vincent of Lerins, quoted on page xvi. He is convinced that if the Anglo-Saxon race is to be won to the full acceptance of the Catholic Faith, it can only be by a faithful adherence to this rule of doctrine. He cannot help feeling that serious obstacles have been raised to the spread of Catholic truth, by laying down as articles of faith pious opinions which are outside that body of doctrine held "everywhere, always, and by all."

May God bless this humble attempt to bring home to members of the Anglican Communion the great truths and principles contained in the "established doctrine and laudable practice of the whole Catholic Church of Christ," which are their lawful heritage, and which our great divines at all times, and the revered leaders of the Catholic Revival in this century, have earnestly maintained and taught.
