# Preface to the Eighth Edition

The author has taken the opportunity afforded by the call for the Eighth Edition, to re-write and enlarge Chapter V. of Part Second. In so doing he has endeavoured to meet the recent unworthy attack made on the validity of Anglican Orders by the bull of Leo XIII., issued in September, 1896. He desires to express his thanks to the Rev. F. W. Puller for examining the portion of the Chapter which deals with the papal bull in question.

South Ascot, November, 1896.
