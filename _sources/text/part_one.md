# The Church of God

> "Within the Catholic Church, we hold that which hath been believed everywhere, always, and of all men: for that is truly and properly Catholic, which comprehendeth all things in general after an universal manner. And that shall we do if we follow Universality, Antiquity, Consent.
>
>
> Universality shall we follow thus, if we profess that One Faith to be true, which the whole Church throughout the world acknowledgeth and confesseth.
>
>
> Antiquity shall we follow, if we part not any whit from those senses which it is plain that our holy elders and fathers generally held.
>
>
> Consent shall we likewise follow, if, in this very Antiquity itself, we hold the definitions and opinions of all, or at any rate almost all, the Priests and Doctors together."
>
> \- Vincent of Lerins, *against Heresy*, Ch. ii.
