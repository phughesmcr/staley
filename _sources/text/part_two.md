OUR LORD WITH ST. AUGUSTINE AND ST. AIDAN.

This illustration is a reproduction of the seal of the Church House, thus described by Archbishop Benson:â€” "The figure of our Lord, taken from one of the most beautiful pictures of Fra Angelico, stands with parted arms upon a rock. From the rock flow out four streams of Paradise into the ocean of the great world. Below him, still on his own rock, stand two great spiritual forefathers of England, St. Aidan, in his Celtic dress, and St. Augustine." The design "thus commemorates Christ's two apostles, sent to our race amid the great world with the blessing of his outspread hands."
